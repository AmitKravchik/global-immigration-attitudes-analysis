       "['Fin de Año Recorrido por los cócteles navideños de las comunidades del sur de Florida ¿De cuántas de estas bebidas has oído hablar? ¿Cuántas has probado? ¿Qué tan del sur de Florida eres? Por Briana Trujillo • Publicado el 31 de diciembre del 2024 • Actualizado a las 1:22 pm del 31 de diciembre del 2024 Telemundo Gabriel Urrutia sonríe radiante cuando habla de todo lo que tiene que ver con el sur de Florida. El nativo de Miami, autor de Miami Sips & Eats y profesor adjunto de la Escuela de Hotelería Chaplin de la Universidad Internacional de Florida no puede contener su emoción y sonríe cuando describe la ubicuidad de una de las bebidas navideñas de nuestra área. “Estuve en Joe Stone Crab y, de hecho, lanzaron el primer coquito, creo, en sus 113 años de historia”, dice Urrutia. “Así que esto demuestra cómo el coquito ha capturado los corazones y las mentes de los habitantes del sur de Florida en todo el mundo”. Noticias de Florida 24/7 en Telemundo 51. MIRA AQUÍ El título de la bebida de invierno más reconocible, más disponible y más aceptada tiene que ser el coquito de Puerto Rico, su propio nombre destaca el ingrediente que Urrutia cree que habla especialmente del sur de Florida. Describe a Miami y al coco como “los mejores amigos de una clase”. No es de extrañar que hayamos hecho del coquito “nuestro plato”. Pero más allá de la lista de ingredientes, es la forma en que bebemos el coquito -y muchas otras bebidas navideñas de la diáspora- lo que cuenta la historia única de inmigración de nuestra región. Manténte al tanto de las noticias locales y del estado del tiempo. Suscríbete a nuestros newsletters gratuitos aquí. SUSCRÍBETE Desde las recetas hasta la forma de servir estas bebidas, la experiencia del coquito, el sorrel jamaiquino, las cremas haitianas, el ponche crema venezolano con una práctica común en comunidad, que forma, establece y reafirma vínculos entre culturas que le dan al sur de Florida su identidad única. Entonces, para alardear de: ¿Cuántas de estas bebidas has oído hablar? ¿Cuántas has probado? Y, por último, piensa: ¿Qué tan del sur de Florida eres? Sorrel ¿Qué lo hace especial? Su color y textura. Es la única bebida de esta lista que no recuerda al ponche de huevo. Local Hace 15 horas Las 5 del 51-Las Noticias más importantes Cuba Hace 16 horas José Daniel Ferrer desafía al régimen cubano mientras crecen las amenazas de su regreso a prisión Comenzaremos con la bebida que se destaca, la colorida mezcla que proviene de Jamaica y cuyo ingrediente principal le da su nombre y tono: el sorrel. Esta bebida navideña, hecha con la parte exterior de la flor de hibisco -que generalmente se cosechaba en invierno, según seriouseats.com-, es agridulce, con sabor a jengibre y un poco de canela. \"Es genial\", dice Urrutia. \"Puedes disfrutarla como si fuera un refresco. Puedes disfrutarla en un té. Pero durante las fiestas, nuevamente, esa hermosa manera de agregarle un poco de alcohol al sorrel real, y obtienes este hermoso licor, casi floral y afrutado\". El ron es el licor base de esta bebida rosada y rojiza. Cremas ¿Qué lo hace especial? El jugo de lima, y \\u200b\\u200bque puedes tomarlo cuando te apetezca. La bebida cremosa y con sabor a ron que se disfruta en las fiestas en Haití ha llegado a la gente del sur de Florida, y Kasa Champet en Pembroke Pines es uno de los lugares que la sirven. Jody Julmice, que es copropietaria del restaurante con su madre, dice que han estado vendiendo este clásico de las fiestas por botella y por copa. “Cuando estás con la familia y abres esa botella de cremas, todos saben automáticamente que va a ser buena. Sabes, nunca antes había probado una crema mala, porque está hecha con tanto amor e intención”, asegura Julmice, quien explica que las recetas de cremas, como las del coquito, se transmiten de generación en generación. “Muchos haitianos lo hacen de diferentes maneras”, apunta Julmice. “No hay cremas realmente perfectas, porque cada uno le añade su toque personal, pero en general, sigue siendo el mismo sabor, y es algo que cualquier haitiano puede reconocer una vez que lo prueba”. ¿Qué es ese sabor que se reconoce al instante? “Vas a sentir el sabor del ron al momento”, asevera Julmice. “Tan pronto como toque tus labios, sentirás el sabor del ron. Es realmente muy bueno. Algunos de los ingredientes principales serían leche evaporada, leche condensada, crema de coco, un poco de nuez moscada, canela, extracto de vainilla, extracto de almendras, jugo de lima. Y luego ese ron Barbancourt o ese Clairin”. Pero la forma en que se comparte la crema, pasando de mano en mano para que los invitados la disfruten en un ambiente íntimo, es lo que, según Julmice, la hace “realmente especial”. \"La cuestión es que se puede beber crema durante todo el día. Podemos tomarla en nuestro café. Podemos tomarla durante la cena, podemos tomarla como postre también. Así que es muy divertido compartirla con la familia\", destaca Julmice. Ponche crema ¿Qué lo hace especial? Es la bebida navideña traída por la última ola de inmigrantes del sur de Florida. Otra interesante bebida navideña que llega al sur de Florida es el ponche crema, una bebida \"que se está volviendo mucho más popular entre muchos de nuestros amigos venezolanos que vienen aquí y traen sus propias versiones\", apunta Urrutia. Se crea con una mezcla de leche condensada azucarada, leche evaporada, ramas de canela, nuez moscada y -a diferencia del coquito- yemas de huevo. En cuanto al licor, hay opciones en cuanto a marcas. \"Venezuela también tiene una cultura del ron muy fuerte, ¿verdad? “Usaremos algunos de esos increíbles rones que hay en Venezuela para poder crear el ponche crema”, reconoce Urrutia. Ahora, lo más importante es que este ponche con leche también es un producto básico en la República Dominicana, donde Urrutia destaca que se elabora con el famoso ron Brugal de la isla. “Me encanta su diversidad. Es realmente genial ver rones de diferentes países [y una] versión diferente de los ingredientes”, explica. Cola de mono ¿Qué lo hace especial? Su nombre extravagante, el licor base y las variaciones de los ponches cremosos típicos. Desde su nombre hasta sus ingredientes, la cola de mono de Chile es algo único. Urrutia, que es mitad chileno, dice que esta bebida navideña, aunque tal vez no sea tan común como las otras en el sur de Florida, es especialmente digna de mención porque demuestra cómo nuestras comunidades de la diáspora se han aferrado a sus raíces y por qué somos mejores por ello. \"La cola de mono en realidad no usa crema, en realidad usa leche entera\", comienza Urrutia. Eso la hace menos cremosa, más aguada y potencialmente \"más atractiva para alguien que tal vez no quiera algo decadente\". Y su licor base no es el ron que nos hemos acostumbrado a ver en este informe. Es pisco, el licor blanco hecho de jugo de uva que también se asocia con frecuencia con Perú. Pero otros dos ingredientes también distinguen a este ponche especial: clavo de olor y café instantáneo. \"Ese café, ese pisco chileno, sabores realmente diferentes. Pero, por supuesto, las hermosas especias y esa cremosidad … realmente te dan ese abrazo navideño por dentro\", dice Urrutia. Crema de vie ¿Qué lo hace especial? Proviene de una de las comunidades más emblemáticas del sur de Florida, y el nombre muestra su estilo. A pesar de pertenecer a una de las comunidades de diáspora más grandes del sur de Florida, esta bebida puede ser menos conocida. Sí, la crema de vie es la bebida navideña tradicional cubana. En cuanto a por qué una frase francesa que se traduce literalmente como \"crema de la vida\" nombraría esta bebida, Urrutia, que también es mitad cubano, piensa que se trata más de actitud que de historia. \"Nos gustan las cosas buenas de la vida, esa es la belleza de eso\", dice. Este ponche se prepara con leche condensada azucarada, leche evaporada, azúcar, agua, vainilla, ron y -a diferencia del coquito- yemas de huevo. Coquito ¿Qué lo hace especial? Conocido en todas partes, es el que probablemente hayas probado, incluso si no eres puertorriqueño. Finalmente, volvemos al punto de partida, a la bebida que se prepara con esmero, se regala con cariño y se sirve con cuidado en los hogares, oficinas y eventos del sur de Florida durante las fiestas. A Puerto Rico, debemos ofrecer un sincero \"gracias\" por el coquito. Urrutia cree que debemos darle crédito a quien lo merece. Aquí, el coquito es el rey. \"Tienes esa sensación de \\'Oh, creo que los puertorriqueños tienen razón en esto\\'\", dice sobre la cultura de beber en las fiestas del sur de Florida. \"Lo que realmente me encanta de esto es que no es tanto como ir a mi bar a buscar mi coquito favorito\". En cambio, como el coquito está pensado para compartirse socialmente, significa que alguien tuvo que aprender una receta, embotellarla en un recipiente especial o en la botella de ron que se usó para prepararla -lo que en sí es un gesto casual pero vulnerable-, presentársela al anfitrión, tal vez incluso meterla en su refrigerador para mantenerla fría durante unas horas antes de finalmente abrirla para que todos la disfruten. Luego, probablemente hablarán sobre ello, discutirán y compararán -de manera un tanto competitiva- las recetas. \"El espíritu de la hospitalidad está en esa botella\", dice Urrutia. \"Lo creaste. Le dedicaste trabajo. Creaste este cóctel histórico. Puede ser, ya sabes, generacional. Puede provenir de miembros de la familia, o incluso de una receta que encontraste en Internet, pero el hecho de que hayas puesto todo ese esfuerzo para poder ir y abrirlo y servirlo, ¿no? Eso es increíble\". A estas alturas, los ingredientes del coquito sin huevo no deberían sorprenderte: leche evaporada, crema de coco, leche condensada dulce, vainilla, canela, nuez moscada y ron se combinan para crear una bebida con sabor a postre. Es íntima y placentera. \"Así que traer una botella [de cualquier bebida espirituosa] y simplemente dejarla en la encimera es genial. Gracias. Gracias por traer eso\", asiente Urrutia. \"Pero traer una botella [de coquito] que vamos a beber en un par de horas es aún mejor.

       " 'Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Email Amid what has been portrayed as a “civil war” between the “MAGA Republicans and Big Tech,” over H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, an economic advisor to the Trump campaign has asserted that there is no better way than immigrants to make America great again. The restrictionists in President-elect Donald Trump’s Republican party want fewer visas, and the pro-growth wing wants more, Stephen Moore a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, noted in a commentary on Rasmussen Reports. READ: Elon Musk calls for major reform of H-1B visa program (December 30, 2024) The Trump campaign advisor noted that Trump himself has announced his support for expanding immigrant worker visas, telling the New York Post, “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them.” Despite some traditional nativist concerns that immigrants “take jobs from American workers,” the most recent meta-study published in 2020 by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that, on balance, immigrants are “job creators, not job takers,” Moore wrote citing former AOL CEO Steve Case. “That is because immigrants today as always have high rates of starting businesses, fill niches in the workforce, and create jobs with their purchases of American goods and services,” he stated. The nonpartisan American Immigration Council recently found that 45% of American Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants and their children, Moore noted. The businesses they create are not just in the tech sector, They include retail (Kohl’s), telecommunications (Verizon, AT&T), finance (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup), pharmaceuticals (Pfizer, Moderna), media (News Corp, Fox), transportation (Boeing, JetBlue) and petroleum (Phillips 66, Occidental Petroleum), to name a few. And let’s not forget Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX. The revenues of these first- and second-generation immigrant companies exceed that of any other nation, Moore noted. Elon Musk, who will co-chair the Department of Government Efficiency commission, says he thinks we should double visas for skilled immigrants “yesterday.” He added, “The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. … If you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be.” READ: Trump sides with Musk in H-1B war (December 29, 2024) “It is clear that hardworking and entrepreneurial immigrants in combination with good old Yankee ingenuity is one of the greatest comparative advantages the United States has over nearly every other nation in the world — especially China,” Moore stated asserting, “I can’t think of a better way to make America great again. Meanwhile, Newsweek cited a Rasmussen Reports poll conducted in November to suggest a majority of Americans opposes expansion of the H-1B visa program to address workforce shortages as suggested by Trump and Musk and favors domestic solutions to labor shortages. Newsweek said it has contacted Trump’s transition team for comment via email . The November poll, according to Newsweek, found that 60% of Americans believed the country already had enough talented people to train and recruit for higher-skill roles, while 26% supported increasing the number of foreign workers for such positions. According to the Rasmussen Reports poll, in addition to respondents saying the country had enough talented people for higher-skill roles, 59% believed companies facing shortages in sectors such as construction, manufacturing and hospitality should focus on raising wages and intensifying efforts to recruit unemployed Americans, even if it resulted in higher consumer prices. Only 24% of respondents supported recruiting foreign workers to keep costs down. Industries such as technology, finance and academia are among the most frequent participants in the H-1B visa program. In 2024, major corporations—including Amazon, Googleand Meta—secured thousands of H-1B visas. Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, reportedly brought hundreds of employees to the US through the program. immigration legal immigrants US economy',\n",

In the past four years, visitor numbers from India have increased by five times, and more than two million Indians traveled to the United States in the first eleven months of 2024, a 26% increase over the same period in 2023, according to an embassy release. Over five million Indians already have a nonimmigrant visa to visit the United States and each day the Mission issues thousands more.

This pilot program streamlined the renewal process for thousands of applicants, and the Department of State is working to formally establish a US-based renewal program in 2025, according to the release. The US Mission to India issued tens of thousands of immigrant visas, facilitating legal family reunification and the migration of skilled professionals. \\xa0These immigrant visa holders became permanent residents upon their arrival, adding to the already rich and sizable Indian diaspora community in the United States. The US Mission to India also provided more than 24,000 passports and other consular services to American citizens living and traveling in India.\\xa0 A new version of the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) debuted in 2024, making it easier for the embassy and consulates to contact American citizens during emergencies and send them safety and security alerts. Increased processing of thousands of interview waiver-eligible nonimmigrant visa applications each week made it quicker and easier than ever for Indians to renew their nonimmigrant visas, the embassy stated. By streamlining operations and utilizing global consular resources, the US Mission has been able to redirect its own resources to focus on in-person interviews, reducing wait times for all applicants. More Indian students than ever before now have US student visas.\\xa0 In 2024, India became the top sender of international students for the first time since the 2008/2009 academic year with more than 331,000 students overall studying in the United States.

Trump confirmed via Truth Social in November his administration will utilize \"military assets\" to conduct mass deportations. Homan, who is the former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, told CNN in December at least 100,000 beds will also be needed in detention centers to carry out the program.

       " \"Edit Story Forbes Lifestyle Travel There Is A New Fee And Form For Americans Traveling To London In 2025 Will McGough Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Will McGough writes about travel destinations and outdoor adventures. Following Dec 31, 2024, 06:16pm EST Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Aerial view of London and the Tower Bridge, England, United Kingdom. American travelers will now need to apply for an ETA before arrival. getty Beginning January 8th, 2025, Americans headed to London, or anywhere in the United Kingdom, will have to file for an ETA —an electronic travel authorization—before arrival. It is not technically a visa, and the U.K. Visas and Immigration Office makes that clear, since it does not replace any existing visa requirements for travelers from countries who require them. But, it sort of acts like one for American travelers, since we previously were not required to have any paperwork or incur any cost when entering the U.K. American travelers will now have to pay $10 to apply for the ETA, and every traveler, regardless of age, must obtain one before being granted access to the country (adults can apply on behalf of children and the elderly). No refunds are given. The ETA will give each traveler up to 6 months in the U.K. for “tourism, visiting family and friends, business or short-term study.” To apply, you’ll need your passport, a payment method, and access to an email account. Travelers need to upload photos of their passport as well as their face as part of the application. The decision on the application will come in three days or less. If approved, the ETA is valid for two years, and you can travel to the U.K. as many times as you want during that time (but not longer than six months). If you need to travel spontaneously, you can travel to the U.K. while your ETA application is pending, but you must apply before you depart the United States. The U.K. Visas and Immigration Office created an app where travelers can apply for the ETA. You can learn more about the application process here . Overall, it’s not the end of the world, but American travelers should be aware of the added cost and, moreso, that they need to remember to do it before crossing the pond.

       " 'Local News Elections, fires, health debates, tattoos, and opera all made for robust stories in 2024 KUNM Published\\xa0December 31, 2024 at 4:58 PM MST Facebook Email Print Jeanette Dedios / KUNM Supporters wave signs at a campaign rally for now President-elect Donald Trump\\'s in Albuquerque, N.M., on Oct. 31, 2024. The KUNM news team worked incredibly hard this past year and we wanted to highlight some of our favorite stories as we say goodbye to 2024. Alice Fordham Two years on from historic fire, northern New Mexico communities wait for help to rebuild In 2022, the Calf Canyon/Hermit\\'s Peak fire burned hundreds of homes, after two U.S. Forest Service prescribed burns went awry. The federal government promised billions of dollars to compensate devastated communities, and in this story I looked at how slowly that\\'s coming to people. I\\'ve stayed in touch with several people whose lives were changed forever by the fire, and this story was part of holding the Federal Emergency Management Agency accountable for helping them. Megan Gleason / Source New Mexico Remnants of a house that the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burned up are surrounded by dead trees in Mora County. Pictured on Sept. 12, 2022. Trump comes to New Mexico, where Republicans are courting Hispanic voters hard In the run-up to the election, I started calling around Democratic local officials in Northern New Mexico and was surprised by what I heard. They were concerned that people in their communities, especially younger people and Hispanic people, were drifting toward Trump and the Republican party. So, I took a look at state races, and saw that in the races the Republicans lost most narrowly last time, they were running Hispanic candidates this time around. Then, I spoke to Republican candidates and strategists about their concerted push to make gains among Hispanic voters. When Trump decided to visit New Mexico, it made a lot of sense in that context. When he touched down, he said, \"I’m here for one simple reason. I like you very much, and it’s good for my credentials with the Hispanic or Latino community.\" Though the state ultimately stayed mainly blue, it looked a lot purpler than 2022, and with record numbers of Hispanic, Republican state lawmakers elected. Alice Fordham / KUNM The prickly pear cactus, or opuntia Albuquerque prickly pear festival celebrates abundance of the desert This was a chance to take listeners on a fun day out with me, of music and food and celebration of a native plant. The organizers of this prickly pear festival want people to reconnect to local foods and traditions for a more sustainable life. Mia Casas The art of opera flourishing at Albuquerque Academy This story was an opportunity to combine so many of my passions into one area. A secret fact about me is that I am classically trained in opera! I have been a performer for over a decade now, and when a teacher pitched us this story about a middle school opera club, I was more than intrigued. It was remarkably fun to watch these kids write, direct and produce a full opera. Getting to know young folks who still have passion for classical art was inspiring. New initiative takes on harm reduction in Albuquerque’s music scene I was excited to highlight this unique initiative through a radio story. The underground music scene has historically had a bad reputation surrounding drug use and harm. The Punk Safety Initiative is trying to change that reputation and provide harm-reduction tools to this community. The team is made up of medical students and is now an official nonprofit providing safe use kits, condoms, emergency contraceptives, and other products to reduce harm in the community. Mia Casas / KUNM Projection of tattoo ceremony at Casa Barelas by Ray Kim. Artist explores healing through pain in new book People often think of tattoos as taboo and certainly not healing. One tattoo artist in Albuquerque is trying to change that narrative. Through her book “Sublime Hallucinations ,” Ray Kim explores how tattoos can heal emotional pain and trauma through medicine, ritual, and intention. I got to attend her book release and live tattooing ceremony, as well as interview her privately about this process and her book. Nash Jones Organ donations hit a record high in NM, but the wait for kidneys remains above average This story began when my neighbor Scott Plunket put a giant sign in his yard that said “I need a kidney!” I had to know more, so I knocked on his door. Scott told me about his quest for a live kidney donor while he sat on the waitlist for a deceased donor. I also met Renee Roybal of San Ildefonso, who received a heart transplant in a way that aligned with Pueblo cultural traditions around a body remaining intact for burial. They shared their unique experiences with the process during a year of record organ donation facilitated by New Mexico Donor Services. Barbara Ramirez Matthew Finch kept his Ear to the Ground: Remembering KUNM’s longtime music director Our team at KUNM and the New Mexico music community lost a dear friend and local music champion in Matthew Finch this year. It was my honor to speak with his family, friends and colleagues about the impact his life and work had on all of us. He is deeply missed while his legacy lives on at KUNM and beyond. City officials say Albuquerque’s ‘sanctuary city’ status can withstand federal pressure After Donald Trump was reelected, I took on a series looking at how New Mexico state and city officials were preparing for his next term, particularly his promise to enact mass deportations. In this story, I focused on the City of Albuquerque, where there is a sanctuary city policy that prevents local cooperation with federal immigration officials. I believe it was important to let concerned community members know what the city’s top officials were considering in the lead up to potential deportations and what they do and do not have the power to do. Bryce Dix Bryce Dix / KUNM Red tinted coal gob can be seen on the eastern hill slopes leading into the town of Madrid. Stormwater erosion snakes underneath the hills. How one historic New Mexico mining town is balancing its legacy, tourism, and the climate crisis For those who don’t know, Madrid, New Mexico is one heck of a town. Not only is it the site of one of the oldest coal mining regions in the state, but its large piles of toxic mining waste actually gives residents a serious economic boon for their stark Western aesthetic – attracting both film and tourism dollars. And, naturally, they want to keep it that way. When I heard that the state was putting millions of dollars into a project meant to keep these piles of eroding legacy waste from sweeping into the town’s homes from torrential rains, I had to check it out. This is an example of a process that’s rare nowadays: compromise, trust-building, and problem-solving by the public and state government. Beavers could be the key to fighting climate change in the Southwest I love this story for lots of reasons. I mean, who doesn’t love beavers? Right now, advocates are actively pushing to reintroduce the semi-aquatic rodent into New Mexico’s streams and rivers in the name of the environment. Turns out these small-but-mighty critters have a lot going for them – from fighting wildfires to filtering out pollutants and improving water quality with their dams. Surprised, I decided to take a little road trip to the Jemez Mountains to take a closer look at recovery efforts. This is one of those stories where you\\'ll hear everything that makes radio magical — laughter, the steady trickle of a stream, and the familiar sinking squish of mud under a boot. Climate stories are often full of doom and gloom, but this one is much different. An audio postcard from the Caja del Rio plateau A personal favorite of mine, this audio postcard transports you right into the passenger seat of a pickup truck driving across the Caja del Rio plateau. Nestled just outside of Santa Fe, the Caja is the proposed site of a hotly contested 115kV transmission line by Los Alamos National Laboratories. I’ve closely followed this story for over a year now and have slowly seen efforts to conserve this sacred (and might I say beautiful) piece of land garner serious attention. Most recently, New Mexico’s congressional delegation called on President Joe Biden to designate it a national monument. In my previous reporting, LANL officials told me I should see the Caja for myself and through this story, you can too. Jeanette DeDios Jeanette DeDios / KUNM-FM Shelly Belin, (right) manager of the Mescalero tribal fish hatchery, talks with other volunteers about donated clothing items. Mescalero Apache members speak out on the impact of the South Fork and Salt fires The South Fork and Salt fires came as a surprise to many and that was no different for the KUNM team. We only had a handful of reporters available at the time so we were all working at high capacity. Something that was very clear was that most news outlets were only focusing on Ruidoso and not the Mescalero Apache reservation, which was also feeling the impacts of the fire. I volunteered to travel down to the reservation to talk to members of the community to discuss some of the challenges they were facing. While I was driving down, I was having doubts if anyone would be willing to talk to me in such an urgent time. But to my surprise, I was met with smiles, laughter, and volunteers sorting donations, preparing food, and even asking me if I needed anything. The resistance and resilience of the community to help their own and others is what I took away from this assignment. Jeanette DeDios / KUNM-FM Republican Native American voters Jen Thomasik and Brandy Ross stand outside the Trump rally held in Albuquerque, NM. Native American voters weigh in on this election As a team, KUNM had been covering the election for months and on the heels of election day, President-elect Donald Trump decided to hold a rally in Albuquerque. This was my first time covering a rally and whether Trump was going to be the next president or not, it felt like a once-in-a-lifetime event as a reporter. I had been trying to gain input from the Indigenous community on where they stand between Trump and Harris. Of the people I interviewed at prior election events, I only heard people planning to vote for Harris. This rally was a great opportunity to find Native voters whose beliefs aligned with Trump and were planning to vote for him. Getting their perspective helped bring balance to the overall story about where Native American voters stood in the election. Local Diné author on the rise in Indigenous representation and supporting Native voices in media The most enjoyable interviews are the ones that don’t feel like work. And this story was certainly that; when I talked with local author Ramona Emerson, it felt like I was talking to an old friend. The hardest part was taking a 30 minute interview and cutting it down to 5 ½ minutes. There was so much that Emerson had to say about how Native Americans are portrayed in today’s media, both the good and the bad. And as a fellow filmmaker and writer, she is such an inspiration and I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to interview her on her newest book “Exposure,” a sequel to her first book, “Shutter.” For Native and non-Natives alike, this interview is likely to stir your creative juices and inspire you to start a new project. Daniel Montaño NHD / Stephanie Wilson The New Mexico team show off their hometown pride during the 2024 National History Day national competitions in Washington D.C., which is the culmination of a year-long research project meant to help the kids grow, learn, and develop skills that make them informed citizens. Research competition teaches kids more than history As a public health reporter, sometimes I get caught up reporting negative news, but this was a blast to report on, and included so many great moments, mainly because it includes kids — precocious, intelligent and driven kids. They’re part of National History Day , a nonprofit organization that runs a research competition to get kids excited to learn, and seeks to create well-informed and engaged citizens who can place their society in a broader context. State’s only detox for young people set to open If you were under the age of 18 and dealing with addiction issues before this year, there weren’t any official options to medically detox in New Mexico outside of a hospital. Now Serenity Mesa has a detox on their campus for kids as young as 14, which advocates have been working toward for years. This story was touching to report on. While touring their campus, a young woman who was living there while going through their rehabilitation program interrupted the interview to make sure I knew how much she loved the people and the place itself. Controversial behavioral health law sparks strong responses from supporters and critics alike This ordinance to create a central behavioral health care authority in Bernanillio county proved to be much more divisive than initial reporting would suggest. It was heavily supported by behavioral health providers outside of Bernalillo County’s control, but was absolutely abhorred by behavioral health workers employed by Bernco. This story did not get much attention, besides a cursory review of the bill, prior to my coverage, despite the fact that county employees were very loud about their concerns, which included fear for their safety. Taylor Velazquez Taylor Velazquez / KUNM Cindy Nava speaks to a group of refugees and immigrants recently at Albuquerque High School. Democratic State Senate candidate Cindy Nava could be first former DACA recipient to win elected office In the run-up to the election, I had the opportunity to closely follow one race, State Senate District 9. The race was a tense one between Democrat Cindy Nava and Republican challenger Audrey Trujillo. Trujillo was not a new face to New Mexico politics as she most notably ran for Secretary of State in 2020. However, Trujillo lost that race and while her social media accounts had posts that were anti-Semitic, she would deny reposting them and said her account must have been hacked. Later she admitted that she didn’t think the intentions of the post were racist. Democrat Cindy Nava drew immense national interest, with NPR reaching out to KUNM for a national story on her. When Nava was a child she was brought to the U.S. from Mexico and she would later receive the federal program benefit of Deferred Action for\\xa0 Childhood Arrivals that allowed her the right to live in the country, go to school, and work without the fear of deportation. Later on\\xa0 she would go on to participate in the New Mexico Legislature on policy decisions concerning scholarships for DACA recipients, work in education policy, and would become the first former DACA recipient to receive a White House political appointment and chose to spend her time in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\\xa0 Nava became a U.S. citizen three years agoThe Senate District 9 race made history, as Nava became one of the first former DACA recipients to win public office. Leticia Archuleta / Health Leadership High School Students at the Health Leadership High School. Local charter school has creative plans in getting young people engaged in healthcare careers As one of the poverty and public health reporters at KUNM funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, a big focus area for me this year was the health care worker shortage crisis. In the past, I’ve covered other public health issues like child welfare, poverty, and education, but after digging into this workforce shortage, I found connections among all these issues given long waiting times to see a doctor and how the lack of health care access leads to dangerous outcomes.\\xa0A local charter school, Health Leadership High School, also saw the parallels as well and began to work to get young people interested in medicine. This type of program is integral in helping with the shortage of these workers. The school’s curriculum allows students to apply their studies to the real world, even having paid internships. The school believes that these initiatives will keep young people here to serve their own communities while helping out with the state’s systemic challenges when it comes to education attainment. Albuquerque Public Schools reports progress in reducing chronic absenteeism One of the issues I’ve covered extensively is chronic absenteeism, especially post-pandemic. Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, participated in the Every Day Counts Summit, hosted by the White House, where they reported a decrease of chronic absenteeism this year, after they implemented several initiatives and prioritized community building both inside and outside the school. While sometimes it does feel the news cycle is only reporting the negatives going on in the state, it is always great to highlight any progress that has been made, especially when it comes to issues of education. Megan Kamerick Christy Linder / Project Street Vet Dr. Kwane Stewart treats pets belonging to people are facing housing challenges or living on the street. UNM grad named CNN Hero of the Year for his work as a street vet As news director, I’m not doing much reporting these days since a lot of my time is helping others do their reporting and edit their stories. But I still take some time to do interviews, including on University Showcase, the monthly show I’ve hosted for years. One of my favorites was with Kwane Stewart. The UNM grad works as a street veterinarian and I found his work so inspirational. I volunteer at a soup kitchen and I meet a lot of folks living on the streets with animals, mostly dogs. I feel badly for the pets knowing the challenges they face, but he helped me realize how much they are loved. For some of these folks, these companions have been the difference between living and giving up. Are you searching for friends and family in the South Fork or Salt fires? Find and leave messages here. We were not fully staffed when the South Fork and Salt Fires broke out, and the distance was also challenging for us in terms of coverage. But one of our collaborators, Source New Mexico, had folks on the ground there and the editor at the time, Shaun Griswold, told me people could not reach one another due to the cell phone towers being destroyed. He asked me to set up a hotline, which I’d never done, but I got a Google Voice number and we started putting out the word to call us with messages for loved ones. I spent a solid day answering messages and getting out information. It was exhausting but one of the most fulfilling things I’ve done in a long time. Our effort was highlighted by America Amplified . Milton Jack Snow / Maxwell Museum of Anthropology Buddy Smith and his family on the Navajo Nation \\'Nothing Left For Me\\' focuses on the trauma brought by the Navajo Livestock Reduction Program For me the best part of being a journalist is that I’m always learning. I love this, even when I learn things that are deeply disturbing. I did a show focusing on this exhibit at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology about an episode in our history I’m pretty sure many people have never heard about. The federal government forced Navajo families to give up huge parts of their livestock, nominally as a tool to address the soil erosion that contributed to the Dust Bowl. But in reality, it was another tool to control and mainstream Native Americans. We all need to understand our history, unvarnished, if we are to move forward and create a more just society and this was a story that really brought that home for me. But also, I loved that the curators focused on the amazing resilience of these communities. That’s part of telling the complete story of colonization.',\n",

President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for these visas, but the discussion among his allies has raised questions about the program\\'s future. Also read: President-elect Trump backs Musk on skilled visas, causing rift among his supporters The debate, involving Musk and some of Trump\\'s closest allies, focused on H-1B visas, which allow skilled foreign workers to enter the U.S. The tech industry heavily relies on this program, though critics argue it may undercut wages for American workers. In contrast, Maine\\'s seasonal businesses often utilize the H-2B visa program, which permits foreign workers to temporarily fill specific jobs. Also read: Senator Collins reflects on Jimmy Carter\\'s inspiring legacy beyond his presidency Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) emphasized the need for a clearer understanding of legal versus illegal immigration. \"It\\'s important for people to realize that those restaurants and hotels are searching first for Maine workers, and it\\'s when they can\\'t get them that they apply for H-2B visas,\" Collins said. \"When they\\'re done with their seasonal work, they go back home, they don\\'t stay here, so we need to crack down on illegal immigration, but I think we need to be realistic about our need for temporary H-2B and H-2A workers.\" Maine\\'s congressional delegation successfully secured an additional 65,000 H-2B visas for the next fiscal year, ensuring continued support for the state\\'s seasonal businesses.

(Brandon Bell/Pool via AP, File) TOPICS: Visa programs Temporary foreign workers H-1B visas H-2B visa program Immigration concerns Maine\\'s seasonal businesses Elon Musk Donald Trump PORTLAND (WGME) — A recent debate among Republicans has brought national attention to visa programs for foreign workers, with Elon Musk defending the initiative amid ongoing immigration concerns. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for these visas, but the discussion among his allies has raised questions about the program\\'s future. Also read: President-elect Trump backs Musk on skilled visas, causing rift among his supporters The debate, involving Musk and some of Trump\\'s closest allies, focused on H-1B visas, which allow skilled foreign workers to enter the U.S. The tech industry heavily relies on this program, though critics argue it may undercut wages for American workers. In contrast, Maine\\'s seasonal businesses often utilize the H-2B visa program, which permits foreign workers to temporarily fill specific jobs. Also read: Senator Collins reflects on Jimmy Carter\\'s inspiring legacy beyond his presidency Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) emphasized the need for a clearer understanding of legal versus illegal immigration. \"It\\'s important for people to realize that those restaurants and hotels are searching first for Maine workers, and it\\'s when they can\\'t get them that they apply for H-2B visas,\" Collins said. \"When they\\'re done with their seasonal work, they go back home, they don\\'t stay here, so we need to crack down on illegal immigration, but I think we need to be realistic about our need for temporary H-2B and H-2A workers.\" Maine\\'s congressional delegation successfully secured an additional 65,000 H-2B visas for the next fiscal year, ensuring continued support for the state\\'s seasonal businesses.

       " 'As NewsBusters has shown over the last week, the Cackling Coven of ABC’s The View has said a lot of things throughout 2024, most of them pretty negative and heinous; racist things, incendiary things, made bad predictions about the election, attacked voters, tried to stir up fear , tried to prop up the Democratic ticket, and morally repugnant things. That’s why we’re wrapping up our 2024 retrospective with a look at some of the laughably dumbest things they’ve said. From talk about Nikki Haley’s vagina to dogs biting butts, to them “leaking” with excitement, to claiming the solar eclipse was caused by climate change, this is a collection of some of the most mind numbing, jaw dropping, head scratching, and room-temperature I.Q. things they’ve said over the course of 2024. Proceed with caution as, presented in chronological order, are some pretty braindead comments. Sunny Hostin: ‘Last I Checked’ Nikki Haley ‘Has a Vagina’ Like Hillary Clinton We’re going to start his countdown in January, when Sunny Hostin bitterly lashed out at former Ambassador Nikki Haley in a way that left even her fellow cast members perplexed. In trying to chide Haley’s support among women, Hostin seemed to suggest she’s looked at Haley’s vagina: I don\\'t understand why everyone is backing Nikki Haley especially women. I remember when Hillary Clinton was running, there was a lot of talk about ‘I don\\'t vote for someone just because she has a vagina.’ Well, last I checked Nikki Haley has one too. Co-host Joy Behar asked the question that was likely on the minds of most viewers: “What do you mean, the last you checked?!” “Sunny is full of surprises,” she quipped. Joy Behar: Charlie Chaplin’s Comedy Created Hitler and the Holocaust While attempting to once again equate President-elect Trump with Adolf Hitler, Behar (a comedian) came out against comedy because it supposedly made Trump run for president. “He is one of the most dangerous people of my lifetime to ever be in the Oval Office,” she warned. “And he doesn\\'t have a good sense of humor. We all know at the correspondents’ dinner, when president Obama made a joke about him.” She then blamed Charlie Chaplin’s comedy for creating Hitler and bringing about the Holocaust: “They made fun of Hitler. Charlie Chaplin made fun of Hitler in 1940, by 1945 millions and millions were dead!” In reality, Hitler became chancellor in 1933 and became Fuhrer in 1934. He invaded Poland in 1939, which historians agree marked the start of WWII. And while the Wannsee Conference (the 90-minute meeting to plan what would become known as the Holocaust) did occur in 1942, Hitler’s marginalization of Jews in German started when the Nazis took power in 1933. Additionally, some of the concentration camps were already in operation as prisons prior to the conference. ‘I Know History!’ Joy Behar Thinks NATO Fought Hitler and the Nazis in WWII Keeping the focus on Behar’s understanding (or rather, misunderstanding) of WWII history, she would later falsely insist that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the military alliance that fought and defeated Hitler and the Nazis in WWII. Ironically, it her flub came after she declared “I know history”: Because I know history. And Putin will not stop at Ukraine if they don\\'t -- if we don\\'t help them. And Trump is saying he\\'ll pull out of NATO. These are allies. We were all in this together in World War II, and now he’s going to pull out of this?! Outrageous! If WWII was Behar’s only frame of reference, she might be very surprised to learn who some of our NATO allies were (HINT: they’re former Axis Powers! ) \"I know history!\" Joy Behar thinks NATO was the military alliance that fought against Hitler and the Nazis. pic.twitter.com/cSBnZhCrFJ — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) February 16, 2024 ‘Imma Bite Your Ass!’ The View Defends Biden’s Dog Attacking 24 People In late February, when news broke that President Biden’s undisciplined dog, Commander had attacked 24 people (and still wasn’t put down), the cast took to defending the vicious attacks. They collectively claimed he was picking up on suspicious people that the Secret Service wasn’t (despite most of his victims being said agents). “Well, it makes you wonder. What did he see that nobody else saw?” moderator Whoopi Goldberg declared. Goldberg then pretending to be Commander and started talking about how she was going to “Imma bite your ass” (Click “expand”): GOLDBERG: All you have to do is look at him. HOSTIN: Look at him! GOLDBERG: Can you show that picture again? HOSTIN: Look at his little [inaudible] GOLBERG: He’s like, “That’s right. I\\'m walking. I’m walking here. I\\'m walking here, woo, woo.” HOSTIN: Listen to his name, “Commander!” He’s in charge! GOLDBERG: “Imma bite your ass! Woo, woo!” HOSTIN: He’s a guard dog! The View: ‘Everyone Belongs at a Drag Show!’ ‘Everybody’ Wears Drag! The View has been a big proponent of the degeneracy known as drag shows and have been a big proponent of parents taking kids to see them. During a RuPaul guest appearance, co-host Sara Haines insisted that “everyone belongs at a drag show” and RuPaul claimed everyone (including you, reader) wears drag already: HAINES: None that I\\'ve seen. [laughter] But this is all happening while simultaneously we\\'re watching some places in this country ban drag shows. Now, I want to know your thoughts because to me having -- One of the things that appeals about a drag show and often the community, this is a community that took time to find clarity to see themselves to be authentic when it wasn\\'t one actor on the stage, they had to pave their own way. So, I\\'ve always found everyone belongs at a drag show. What do you think of this? CHARLES: Well, listen, you\\'re born naked and the rest is drag. Everybody is playing a role, everyone. When you get out of the shower you put on your drag. Right? Sunny Hostin Claims the Solar Eclipse, Earthquake Caused by ‘Climate Change’ Observing all the dumb things they said in 2024, this is arguably the dumbest. Just because you graduated from Binghamton University and Notre Dame Law School and were a former federal prosecutor, it doesn’t make you intelligent. Co-host Sunny Hostin proved that April, when she asserted that the solar eclipse, the New Jersey earthquake, and the cicada brood were caused by climate change. Her co-hosts were barely equipped to explain to her how solar eclipse are calculable, how plate tectonics work, or the life cycle of annoying insects: HOSTIN: All those things together, would maybe lead one to believe that either climate change exists, or something is really going on. BEHAR: That’s more on point. ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN: Or Jesus is returning. BEHAR: Except earthquakes are not at the mercy of climate change. It\\'s underground. It can’t. HOSTIN: How about the warming of the planet? GOLDBERG: No, it happens. And the eclipse, they\\'ve known about the eclipse coming because eclipses happen and they actually can say when these things are going to happen. Navarro Defends Menendez, Blames Wife, Argues ‘Costco Sells Gold Bars’ When now-former Democratic Senator Bob Menendez (NJ) was formally charged with corruption, fake Republican co-host Ana Navarro did more than just mourn for her friend; she defending him by blaming his wife and pointed to Costco. She even bragged about bringing her wealthy clients to see him: His trial begins in a couple of weeks, I think, in two or three weeks. And look, and every time we talk about this I always want to start by saying, I think I\\'m biased. I try to be objective but I\\'ve known Bob Menendez for almost 30 years. I’ve worked with him on countless issues, Cuba, Nicaragua, immigration, Central American free trade. This Menendez that I read about here just does not jive, does not square away with the man I\\'ve known for all of this time. It\\'s hard for me to understand all of these facts. I’ve went to him with 100 issues with very rich clients, he never ever did anything like this. The View Was \\'Leaking\\' in Excitement After Trump Was Found Guilty, Want Prison Things got gross in May after Trump was found guilty on 34 felonies in the politically motivated hush money case against him. In addition to Goldberg making a rare appearance on a Friday show to celebrate the news, Behar gave the audience too much information when so admitted to “leaking” in the aisle of her local Costco when she was notified of the development: BEHAR: Well, my reaction I was at Costco buying ten boxes of Keurig coffee and my watch started to buzz and I got so excited I started leaking a little bit. [Laughter] But wait, this is what I had to say! GOLDBERG: So, you\\'re the leaker. BEHAR: I\\'m the leaker. The View Has Suspicion COVID’s Origin ‘Wasn’t in this Country,’ Maybe a Lab No one has ever accused The View of being on top of the news. The year was 2024 and the liberal ladies were only now getting suspicions that COVID’s origins weren’t in the U.S. and that it was possibly from a lab: HOSTIN: They say they cannot find out what happened here in the United States in terms of the origin of COVID. Well, maybe because the origin wasn\\'t in this country. Maybe it was in another country and maybe they need to now start looking for – at other countries. BEHAR: Didn’t they say it possibly came out of a lab? HOSTIN: Yes. Whoopi: We Don’t Allow Lies on The View This one is extremely laughable. Goldberg claimed they never lie on the show because it’s something they just “can’t have” going on: Now we all have -- we have been given doubts that people don\\'t know how to do this. The media has pretty much always been fair to each side, and now when we\\'ve gone to this place where you only hear this -- see, we have to tell you both sides. That\\'s why Alyssa\\'s here. That\\'s why Ana\\'s here, because we don\\'t all think the same way, and it\\'s like you all. You all don\\'t think the same way so you want to hear what other people say, but when they\\'re lying, we can\\'t have it. We can\\'t allow on this show to have things said that we know for a fact are not true. That\\'s what it used to be. That\\'s what it needs to go back to being, and that\\'s where y\\'all come in. It\\'s okay to feel how you feel, but demand the truth. Demand folk’s fact check what they\\'re telling you because what they’re telling you is important. The View Brags About How Easy It Would Be to Cheat on Their Husbands While not politics related, the ladies of The View disclosed a lot about themselves when they bragged about how easy it would be to get away with cheating on their husbands; and giving their men possibly enough justification to hire private investigators (Click “expand”):: ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN: I would preface this to say: My husband is the love of my life, I would never cheat on him, but I could absolutely get away with it! (...) HAINES: I get a haircut and my husband doesn\\'t notice. He\\'s looking at my face. And the other thing is, Max will may coffee – there are days I\\'ve come down to the coffee machine and there\\'s no coffee in it, it’s just hot water. Or he’ll leave the pot out and it’s all coffee on the counter. He – Like, if he doesn\\'t finish what he\\'s doing and pay attention he\\'s like a little nutty. (...) NAVARRO: Al, if he\\'s watching football, like if he\\'s watching the Dolphins, I could literally bring a man into the house, have him in his bed, and if the Dolphins win he could probably spend the night and Al wouldn\\'t even know. Ana Navarro: You ‘Can’t Be Relaxing and Enjoying Christmas’ Because Trump Their idiocy continued straight into the Christmas season with Navarro having an absolute mental breakdown as she shouted about how “winter is coming” and people shouldn’t be relaxing and enjoying the holiday with their loved ones because Trump was returning to office. Her Trump Derangement syndrome was on full display: NAVARRO: If you are an illegal immigrant in this country, you\\'re not going to be not in panic! If you are a woman working for the Department of Defense, you have a right to be in a panic! GOLDBERG: Ana, you tell people to say fraught and like this! That is not -- NAVARRO: No, I\\'m telling people to prepare, Whoopi! I\\'m telling people to prepare! GOLDBERG: You think they aren\\'t prepared? They are prepared. I’m saying to people – NAVARRO: So, that means they can\\'t be relaxing and enjoying Christmas when winter is coming! She also demanded everyone give their money to Liz Cheney so she could afford a lawyer to protect her from Trump’s Department of Justice.',\n",
       " \"Politics Dems urge Biden to preserve immigration program that prevents deportations to certain countries — before Trump can cut it By Victor Nava Published Dec. 31, 2024 Updated Dec. 31, 2024, 10:08 p.m. ET Several Senate Democrats implored President Biden earlier this month to take action to preserve a controversial immigration program that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to wind down when he takes office. “As Senators who represent diverse states across our nation and who collectively represent millions of immigrant families, we write to express our deep concern about the threat the incoming administration poses to immigrants in our communities,” Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IIl), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) wrote in a Dec. 10 letter to Biden. The senators argue that Trump’s pledge to embark on a mass deportation initiative will “jeopardize the safety and security of millions of mixed-status families, sow deep distrust and fear in the communities we represent, and destabilize the U.S. economy” and demand that Biden, 82, act fast to further entrench programs that allowed record numbers of migrants to flow into the US under his administration. 4 The Temporary Status Program was established in the 1990s. Getty Images 4 The Biden administration re-designated a number of countries for TPS, including Haiti, Venezuela, and Afghanistan. Getty Images “We write now because the window to secure and finalize your administration’s policies is closing rapidly,” the lawmakers wrote. “We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families.” Explore More Giants Super Bowl hero and ex-con's Super Bowl ring hits the auction block Trump rules out deporting Prince Harry — while taking jab at wife Meghan Markle CNN mixes up Barack Obama with Osama bin Laden in embarrassing on-air flub The senators argue that in its final days, the Biden administration should prioritize redesignating and extending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for “all eligible countries and consider providing Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) as appropriate.” TPS and DED grant migrants for several designated countries up to 18 months of amnesty from deportation as well as access to work permits if they’re in the US illegally. 4 The first Trump administration looked to wind down TPS for several countries. Gregory P. Mango The programs are intended to be used in cases where suffering and unrest is so great in a migrant’s home country that it would be unsafe to deport them back. The Biden administration has designated or re-designated several countries for TPS since 2021, including Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan. 4 Democrats have been urging Biden to extend protections under TPS. Robert Mecea The 17-country list of TPS-designated nations also includes: Myanmar, Cameroon, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Honduras, Lebanon, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. The Democratic senators contend that “worsening crises in countries across the world” underscore “the need for TPS.” The lawmakers also suggest that the Biden administration should add the Democratic Republic of Congo to the list of TPS nations. “We urge your administration to offer vital protections via TPS for eligible countries or parts of countries, providing relief from deportation while allowing these individuals to continue working and contributing to our economy,” the senators ask Biden. “Where TPS is not an option, we strongly urge the administration to protect qualified vulnerable noncitizens through DED.” During his first term, Trump sought to remove the TPS designations of several countries, such as Haiti, but a series of lawsuits thwarted him from doing so. TPS became a hot-button issue on the 2024 campaign trail amid reports that Haitian migrants were overwhelming towns like Springfield, Ohio , leading Trump to pledge to revoke TPS for Haiti. “It’s been overrun,” the president-elect said of the Ohio town in an October interview with NewsNation. “You can’t do that to people.

       " \"President Jimmy Carter at his desk in the Oval Office prior to delivering a speech on April 19, 1977. Charles W. Harrity/AP Editor’s Note: A version of this story published last year after President Carter entered hospice care. CNN — Steps that Jimmy Carter took during his presidency are still shaping the United States, decades after he left office. But they didn’t help him at the polls. Because of Carter’s actions, hundreds of thousands of people fleeing persecution had a chance to come to the United States when he was commander-in-chief. And millions more resettled in the US after he left office. “He was well aware of the political cost,” says Carter biographer Kai Bird, author of “The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter.” When it came to taking on tough issues, Bird says, Carter didn’t shy away from doing what he thought was right. And that’s where Carter found himself in the summer of 1979, making a decision that went against what polls said that most Americans wanted. Most Americans disapproved. Carter still took this step The scenes from the other side of the world were devastating. Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing government oppression in Southeast Asia were taking to the sea, and many were drowning as they tried to escape. A crisis that began before Carter took office was becoming increasingly dire by the day. In 1978, Carter ordered American ships to pick up refugees fleeing by boat. A year later, the exodus had only intensified. And as world leaders met to discuss top issues facing their countries, Carter took a dramatic stand, announcing the US would double the number of refugees accepted monthly from the region from 7,000 to 14,000. The move, according to news reports at the time, was aimed at pushing other countries to take similarly significant steps. Many of the refugees who left Vietnam in the years after Saigon fell fled on boats and found safe harbor, like the group pictured here in 1978. But thousands did not survive the journey. Fred Ihrt/LightRocket/Getty Images It was not politically popular. As writer Thu-Huong Ha noted in a 2016 piece for Quartz, a poll from CBS and The New York Times showed that 62% of Americans disapproved. And a Gallup poll indicated 57% of Americans were opposed to the US relaxing its immigration policies for refugees from the region. Carter did it anyway. “We are prepared to act with the compassion that has traditionally characterized the United States when confronted with such situations of human crisis,” Carter said in a statement released by the White House as he announced the new policy. “Thousands of human lives are at stake.” She says her family found freedom because of Carter’s ‘political courage’ Bee Nguyen says it’s something her family never forgot. “My mom is what you would consider apolitical. My father is conservative. … (President Carter) was the one political person that both my parents spoke about with respect and fondness, and still do to this day,” says Nguyen, a former Georgia state representative. That respect, Nguyen says, was earned by actions that Carter took that changed the course of her parents’ lives. Nguyen says her parents fled Vietnam by boat in 1978. A Thai fisherman rescued them, she says, and they spent months in refugee camps in Thailand. “My parents, they risked their lives. They left a country in which they experienced the loss of civil liberties, in which my father was incarcerated by his own government. And they were in search of freedom,” Nguyen says. They found it in Iowa, where they moved in 1979. “They were only able to do so because of the political courage exercised by President Carter,” she says. As #AAPIHeritageMonth comes to a close, I honor every day: my father – he served in the Vietnamese army, was imprisoned by his government & built a life in America as an engineer & pharmacist. My mother – she helped facilitate her family's escape by boat & raised 5 daughters. ♥️ pic.twitter.com/VZa8vYxQIj — Bee Nguyen 🐝 (@BeeForGeorgia) May 25, 2023 Nguyen was born a few years later, and she says what she heard about Carter growing up – and about Iowa’s then-governor, Republican Robert Ray, who also made a point of welcoming refugees – shaped her own views about America. To Nguyen, the stand Carter and other politicians took is just as important today as it was when her parents first arrived. Over the years, Americans’ views on their responsibilities toward refugees have fluctuated. In 2022, 72% of Americans said taking in refugees from countries where people are trying to escape violence and war should be a very or somewhat important goal for US immigration policy, according to a Pew Research Center survey , but opinions varied widely by party, race and ethnicity. “It’s important for us to learn as a country, to remember and understand that we as a nation from a values perspective and by law … we promised as a nation to be a safe harbor for people who are fleeing, for people whose lives are in danger,” she says. Carter’s fateful decision that summer of 1979 wasn’t the only step he took in that direction. Carter signed a law that paved the way for millions of people to come to the US On the frigid day when Faith Akovi Cooper first set foot in the United States with her mother and siblings, Carter was no longer in office. But she says she sees a direct connection between the former US president and the life she’s led since that day in January 1993. Back then, she was a refugee who’d fled war in Liberia. And thanks to a law Carter signed, the Refugee Act of 1980, her family was able to move to Reston, Virginia. The law, signed by President Carter in March 1980, created the framework that’s used to help those fleeing persecution around the world seek a better life in the United States. “My family is here today as a result of that act,” Cooper says. And now, as the International Rescue Committee’s regional director for resettlement, asylum and integration in the Southern US border region, she says she’s even more aware of how vast the law’s impact has been. “Millions of people have had the chance to rebuild their lives in the United States,” Cooper says. This family photo taken in Liberia shows Faith Akovi Cooper, right, and her mother, Abena Clement. Cooper says all the mementos from her childhood were lost when her home was destroyed during Liberia's civil war, but a family member gave her this photo shortly after she arrived in the United States. Courtesy Faith Cooper She was one of them. Rebuilding her life in the US included pursuing a career in global health and eventually going on to work for a leading refugee resettlement organization. More than 3 million refugees have come to the United States since 1980, including such well-known figures as actor Mila Kunis, singer Regina Spektor and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Millions are taxpaying Americans who have contributed greatly to our communities and to our economy,” Carter said in a 2021 statement commemorating the act’s anniversary. More than 125,000 refugees from Southeast Asia had fled to the US in the immediate aftermath of Saigon’s fall, and even more would come during Carter’s presidency. While fewer refugees came to the US annually after Carter left office, the country’s refugee resettlement program created by the 1980 act became a sought-after pathway. The law officially defined a refugee as someone with a “well-founded fear of persecution,” nearly tripled the number refugees the United States would accept and created a process for adjusting that number in emergencies. “Desperate refugees were drowning and dying from exposure at our doorstep, yet the United States lacked a legal structure to receive them in an orderly way,” Carter said in 2021. While Carter’s earlier move to welcome more refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos wasn’t politically popular, the Refugee Act sailed to approval in Congress with nearly unanimous support. “This was a humanitarian crisis, which Republicans and Democrats agreed on. And even in the midst of a very bitter primary campaign … we were still able to cooperate, because the problem was so massive and so important,” Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser during his presidency, recalled in a 2019 interview with HIAS. The ink was barely dry when an unexpected challenge arose But it wasn’t long before Carter would once again find himself making an unpopular decision. “We were challenged almost immediately, when the act was hardly dry, with crises that were not anticipated,” Eizenstat said in the 2019 HIAS interview. One of the most significant ones unfolded less than 100 miles from America’s shores. In April 1980, Cuban President Fidel Castro proclaimed that any Cuban citizen who wanted to emigrate to the United States could do so. The catch? They had to depart from the port of Mariel, about 30 miles from Havana. And they had to have arranged for someone on a boat to pick them up and take them to Florida. A US Marine helps a young Cuban child off a boat arriving in Key West, Florida, on May 10, 1980. Fernando Yovera/AP A few weeks later, addressing the League of Women Voters national convention in Miami, Carter noted that the US was a “country of refugees” that would “continue to provide an open heart and open arms” to those fleeing Cuba. The operation became known as the Mariel boatlift. Carter referred to the boats as “freedom flotillas.” But media coverage of those escaping oppression for the chance at a better life was quickly drowned out by reports claiming that Castro had also taken the opportunity to empty jails and mental institutions. In an interview with CNN on the network’s first day broadcasting, June 1, 1980, Carter faced questions over a Cuban refugee uprising at an Arkansas resettlement center, where buildings were set ablaze and hostages were taken. Several thousand hardened criminals did make their way to the United States during that exodus of 125,000 people, says José Manuel García, an associate professor of Hispanic literature and Latin American studies at Florida Southern College. It was a small fraction of the group, says García, who was part of the boatlift himself and has written a book and worked on a documentary sharing the experiences of others who made the journey. Florida Democrats shake President Jimmy Carter's hand as he enters the Florida House of Representatives chamber on October 10, 1980, prior to signing a bill providing up to $100 million to help reimburse Florida and other states after an influx of arrivals from Cuba and Haiti. Foley/AP García was 13 years old when he left Cuba with his family. And he says many Cubans who made that same journey went on to build successful businesses and media careers in the United States. But the bad reputation of the Cubans known as Marielitos firmly took root, even getting a mention in the opening of the 1983 movie “Scarface.” “Even years later, 40 years later, whenever I tell somebody…the first thing that pops in their mind is, ‘You came with those criminals.’ That is the image that has persisted,” García says. He says he sees Carter’s legacy differently than many Cuban Americans Carter, who was running for a second term, eventually shifted his stance on the boatlift. Washington and Havana agreed it would end just days before the 1980 election. Analysts argued Carter’s handling of the crisis was a factor contributing to his loss to Ronald Reagan. Beyond the 1980 presidential vote, there was likely another longer-term cost for Democrats, biographer Bird notes. The boatlift played a role in bolstering South Florida’s conservative political landscape, he says, as many Cubans who fled Castro’s communist regime ended up voting Republican once they became US citizens. This family photo shows José Manuel García with his father, mother and sister in 1980 a few days after they arrived in New York City after coming to the US in the Mariel boatlift. Courtesy Jose Manuel Garcia Among more conservative Cuban Americans, Carter is not a popular figure, García says. Many saw his handling of the boatlift as weak, and felt he was easily manipulated by Castro. But García says he sees Carter’s legacy differently. “He was a humanitarian. And this is somebody whose primary goal was, ‘We’re going to help these poor people who are escaping communism. They want a better life, and we’re going to do whatever we can to support them,’” he says. “I’ve had all these opportunities because of the fact that the Mariel boatlift happened … and President Carter was willing to help us come to the United States.” Carter’s actions may have cost him reelection, but García says they gave him — and so many others — a chance to live the lives they’d dreamed of having.\",\n",
       " 'Posted on December 31, 2024 Smugglers Abandon Two Migrant Girls at Southern Border With Note to Authorities Adam Shaw, Fox News, December 30, 2024 Smugglers abandoned two migrant children at the southern border in Texas this week , fleeing back to Mexico as Texas authorities came to the little girls’ rescue, amid continued concerns about the numbers of unaccompanied minors coming across the border. The Texas Department of Public Safety said that its troopers had recovered the two little girls, who are five and nine years old, after the smuggler had abandoned them and fled back to Mexico. The girls, from El Salvador, carried only a note with an address and phone number, and were then referred to U.S. Border Patrol. {snip} There have been a number of incidents of abandoned children being rescued, often with phone numbers or addresses of relatives or others written on paper or stitched into clothing. When children arrive unaccompanied, they are transferred eventually to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and released to sponsors in the U.S. The issue made headlines earlier this year when the DHS Office of Inspector General sent a report to Congress finding that, over the past five years, more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children [UCs] had not shown up for immigration court hearings {snip} {snip}',\n",

       " 'Posted on December 31, 2024 ICE Shuts Down Programs Offering Services to Illegal Immigrants Adam Shaw and Bill Melugin, Fox News, December 30, 2024 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has ended two programs that provide social services to illegal immigrants who are released into the U.S. interior, telling lawmakers that one brings “immense cost with little improvement” and that another is out of line with ICE’s mission. The agency responded to Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and 15 members of Congress, who wrote to ICE in May asking for more information about the “Alternatives to Detention” program, which monitors illegal immigrants not in ICE detention. The agency defended the program and said it was “an efficient and effective” program for monitoring a segment of illegal immigrants on ICE’s non-detained docket. ICE only has around 40,000 beds available to it at one time, while it has a non-detained docket of nearly 7.7 million people – a number that has soared during the Biden administration. Of those, just over 181,000 are enrolled in Alternatives to Detention monitoring program, where migrants are monitored either by an app check-in or a GPS monitor. But in recent years, the agency has also created separate programs to offer various services and assistance to those not in detention. In the letter, the agency says that some of those programs are ending. One is the Wraparound Stabilization Service (WSS), which ICE says began in February 2020 and involves working with NGOs to offer “services that provide psychosocial and behavioral health support for vulnerable participants and their families who would benefit from additional stabilization services.” ICE says the program stopped referrals in July, and that the program was ineffective in what it sought to do, having only a 2% higher compliance rate from those who took part in services compared to those who did not. “ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations [ERO] notes the challenge with the WSS was its immense cost with little improvement,” it says. {snip} ICE had previously cited difficulties with the program including a cumbersome identification and referral process, a substantial increase in participants and a lack of resources. The agency also says it had decided in June not to continue a vendor contract for the Young Adult Case Management (YACMP) program. That program offered 18-and 19-year-old migrants legal services, screenings, referrals to social service programs and human trafficking screenings . {snip} {snip}',\n",

       " 'Analytics Insights Tech Litigation in 2024 By the Numbers Facebook Twitter Linkedin by David Nayer December 31, 2024 As the year 2024 draws to a close, Docket Alarm analytics reveals that federal litigation is down in comparison to 2023,. 966,675 cases were filed in federal court in 2024, in comparison to 1,056,671 filed in 2023. Cases in 2023 Cases in 2024 This decrease of about 90,000 cases can be partially explained by the lack of multidistrict litigation. In 2023, the top jurisdiction for federal litigation was the Northern District of Florida, home to the massive 3M Combat Arms Earplugs multidistrict litigation, as covered by Law Street . This case concerned earplugs manufactured by a 3M subsidiary and distributed to soldiers; the lawsuits allege that the earplugs were defective and failed to protect the soldiers. The case settled in 2018 but the settlement claims process continued well into 2023. The Northern District of Florida served as the court where claims under this lawsuit were filed. Lawsuits against 3M spiked in 2023, but had comparatively little presence in 2024. The Northern District of Florida does not appear in the top 10 of filing jurisdictions in 2024. Taking Florida’s place in 2024 is the District of Arizona. Similar to the Florida instance, Arizona is home to another growing multidistrict litigation, In re Bard Implanted Port Catheter Products Liability Litigation In 2024, a greater proportion of the top 10 filing jurisdictions were bankruptcy courts. A forthcoming article will analyze bankruptcies in 2024 in comparison to prior years. 2023 Case Types Some trends have not changed from 2023 to 2024. Prisoner litigation is a top case type in both years, with around 18,000 cases. It is the top case type in 2024, but it lost out to Products Liability and Civil Rights in 2023. 2024 Case Types Other top case types in both years include insurance, contract, and immigration – but their order is different, depending on the year. Immigration and employment law cases are up, while personal injury matters are down year-over-year. Finally, the top non-governmental law firm in federal cases filed in 2024 is Drinker Biddle & Reath. The firm merged with Faegre Baker Daniels in 2020 to become Faegre Drinker, but federal court data occasionally retains pre-merger law firms for long-running cases. THe cases attributed to Drinker Biddle include another mutlidistrict matter against Johnson & Johnson . The firm represents the pharmaceutical company. The top filing law firm in 2024 was Arnold & Itkin. They are a plaintiff’s law firm; they represent plaintiffs in multistrict cases including the aforementioned same matter against Johnson & Johnson. . Tags Insights Facebook Twitter Linkedin',\n",

       " 'Woman burned to death inside New York City subway is identified Associated Press Dec 31, 2024 Dec 31, 2024 Updated Dec 31, 2024 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save NEW YORK (AP) — The woman who died after being set on fire in a New York subway train earlier this month was a 57-year-old from New Jersey, New York City police announced Tuesday. The woman, Debrina Kawam, was from Toms River, a township on the Jersey Shore, according to the NYPD. New York City Mayor Eric Adams added that Kawam had a “brief stint in our homeless shelter system,” though did not say when. It appears Kawam recently moved to New York and had a very brief interaction with the city\\'s outreach services, according to the New York City Department of Homeless Services. The man accused of lighting her on fire on Dec. 22, Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was taken into custody hours after police disseminated images of a suspect in the shocking Sunday morning attack on a train stopped in Brooklyn\\'s Coney Island. He has since been indicted on murder and arson charges. Identifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her. Adams said at an unrelated press briefing Tuesday that he didn\\'t know more than Kawam\\'s name and New Jersey address, but said authorities had been in contact with her next of kin. “Hearts go out to the family, a horrific incident to have to live through,” Adams said. “It impacts on how New Yorkers feel. But it really reinforces what I’ve been saying: People should not be living on our subway system, they should be in a place of care. No matter where she lived that should not have happened.” In an emailed statement, a New York City Department of Social Services spokesperson said the city\\'s homelessness agency worked with partners to track down any information they could on the victim’s family. “As we mourn this loss, we resolve to double down on our outreach efforts to reach and support New Yorkers experiencing unsheltered homelessness on city streets and subways and ensure they consistently access shelter services,\" the spokesperson said. Authorities have said they don\\'t believe Kawam and Zapeta knew each other. Federal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the U.S. illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support. Prosecutors allege both Kawam and Zapeta were on the stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station when Zapeta approached a sleeping Kawam and set her clothing on fire. He then fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned, prosecutors said. Kawam was pronounced dead at the scene. Zapeta was arrested later that day after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students. Zapeta has yet to enter a plea in the case and remains jailed. He was not present at a court hearing Friday where his indictment was announced and his attorney declined to comment afterward. Prosecutor Ari Rottenberg said at the hearing that Zapeta told police he drinks a lot of liquor and doesn’t know what happened. He did, however, identify himself in photos and surveillance video showing the fire being lit, Rottenberg said. “This was a malicious deed,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said after the Friday hearing. ___ This story corrects Kawam\\'s age based on updated information from the police.

       " \"Roberts warns against ignoring Supreme Court rulings as tension with Trump looms John Fritze, CNN Tue, December 31, 2024 at 11:01 PM UTC 4 min read The US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, US, on October 2, 2024. Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts slammed what he described as “dangerous” talk by some officials about ignoring federal court rulings, using an annual report weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office to stress the importance of an independent judiciary. Officials “from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,” Roberts wrote in the report, released by the Supreme Court on Tuesday. “These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.” The chief justice didn’t detail which officials he had in mind – and both Republicans and Democrats have hinted at ignoring court rulings in recent years. Still, Roberts’ year-end message landed days before the January 20 inauguration of a president who has repeatedly decried the federal judiciary as rigged. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump’s agenda – particularly on immigration – could put the incoming president on a collision course next year with a Supreme Court he has helped to build by naming three conservative justices during his first term. “Every administration suffers defeats in the court system – sometimes in cases with major ramifications,” Roberts wrote. And yet, he added, “for the past several decades,” both parties have respected court decisions and have headed off the kind of constitutional confrontations that arose during the civil rights era when some southern states declined court orders to integrate. Roberts, in particular, pointed to decisions by the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations to enforce school desegregation rulings. In 1957, for instance, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to integrate its schools after officials sought to defy Supreme Court decisions that found segregated schools unconstitutional. Roberts lamented that “public officials,” whom he also did not name, had “regrettably” attempted to intimidate judges by “suggesting political bias in the judge’s adverse rulings without a credible basis for such allegations.” Those attempts, he warned, are “inappropriate and should be vigorously opposed.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement As in past years, the chief justice avoided direct mention of the controversies and challenges brewing within the Supreme Court itself – including lingering questions about ethics , a weekslong scandal this year over controversial flags hoisted at Justice Samuel Alito’s properties and sagging public confidence in the nation’s highest court. In a series of interviews before the election, Vice President-elect JD Vance raised doubts about his fidelity to Supreme Court decisions. In a 2021 podcast, as The New York Times previously reported, Vance urged Trump to respond to adverse court rulings “like Andrew Jackson did and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’” The likely apocryphal quote came in response to an 1832 decision Jackson opposed that dealt with Native Americans. Trump himself has often blasted federal courts – including the Supreme Court – over adverse decisions. A spokesman for Trump’s campaign earlier this week slammed the “political weaponization of our justice system” in a response to a federal appeals court ruling in New York that upheld a jury’s verdict finding that the former president sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Democrats, too, have toyed publicly with declining to enforce court decisions. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew criticism last year for suggesting on CNN that the Biden administration “ignore” a district court decision that would have halted Food and Drug Administration of the abortion pill mifepristone.

       " 'Roberts warns against ignoring Supreme Court rulings as tension with Trump looms John Fritze, CNN January 1, 2025 at 1:01 AM The US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, US, on October 2, 2024. (Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images) Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts slammed what he described as “dangerous” talk by some officials about ignoring federal court rulings, using an annual report weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office to stress the importance of an independent judiciary. Officials “from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,” Roberts wrote in the report, released by the Supreme Court on Tuesday. “These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.” The chief justice didn’t detail which officials he had in mind – and both Republicans and Democrats have hinted at ignoring court rulings in recent years. Still, Roberts’ year-end message landed days before the January 20 inauguration of a president who has repeatedly decried the federal judiciary as rigged. Trump’s agenda – particularly on immigration – could put the incoming president on a collision course next year with a Supreme Court he has helped to build by naming three conservative justices during his first term. “Every administration suffers defeats in the court system – sometimes in cases with major ramifications,” Roberts wrote. And yet, he added, “for the past several decades,” both parties have respected court decisions and have headed off the kind of constitutional confrontations that arose during the civil rights era when some southern states declined court orders to integrate. Roberts, in particular, pointed to decisions by the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations to enforce school desegregation rulings. In 1957, for instance, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to integrate its schools after officials sought to defy Supreme Court decisions that found segregated schools unconstitutional. Roberts lamented that “public officials,” whom he also did not name, had “regrettably” attempted to intimidate judges by “suggesting political bias in the judge’s adverse rulings without a credible basis for such allegations.” Those attempts, he warned, are “inappropriate and should be vigorously opposed.” As in past years, the chief justice avoided direct mention of the controversies and challenges brewing within the Supreme Court itself – including lingering questions about ethics , a weekslong scandal this year over controversial flags hoisted at Justice Samuel Alito’s properties and sagging public confidence in the nation’s highest court. In a series of interviews before the election, Vice President-elect JD Vance raised doubts about his fidelity to Supreme Court decisions. In a 2021 podcast, as The New York Times previously reported, Vance urged Trump to respond to adverse court rulings “like Andrew Jackson did and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.’” The likely apocryphal quote came in response to an 1832 decision Jackson opposed that dealt with Native Americans. Trump himself has often blasted federal courts – including the Supreme Court – over adverse decisions. A spokesman for Trump’s campaign earlier this week slammed the “political weaponization of our justice system” in a response to a federal appeals court ruling in New York that upheld a jury’s verdict finding that the former president sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll. Democrats, too, have toyed publicly with declining to enforce court decisions. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew criticism last year for suggesting on CNN that the Biden administration “ignore” a district court decision that would have halted Food and Drug Administration of the abortion pill mifepristone. The Supreme Court paused that decision and, in June, tossed the lawsuit challenging wider access to the drug. Roberts has repeatedly used his year-end report to tout the importance of an independent judiciary and to sound an alarm about threats of violence against judges . Two years ago, in a similar vein, he stressed that “a judicial system cannot and should not live in fear.” In this year’s report, Roberts added that “hostile foreign state actors” had accelerated attacks on the judiciary and other branches. In some instances, he said, “bots distort judicial decisions, using fake or exaggerated narratives to foment discord within our democracy.” The report lands at the end of a year in which the conservative 6-3 majority granted former presidents sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution – and on a timeline that allowed Trump to avoid a trial on federal charges in two cases before the November election.

       " \"Nation World New York Police identify woman burned to death inside subway train The man accused of lighting her on fire, Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was taken into custody and charged with murder and arson. Credit: AP New York Police officers clear a train at the Coney Island Stillwell Avenue Terminal, May 5, 2020, in the Brooklyn borough of New York. Author: Associated Press Published: 1:22 PM EST December 31, 2024 Updated: 4:43 PM EST December 31, 2024 NEW YORK — The woman who died after being set on fire in a New York subway train earlier this month was a 57-year-old from New Jersey, New York City police announced Tuesday. The woman, Debrina Kawam, was from Toms River, a township on the Jersey Shore, according to the NYPD. New York City Mayor Eric Adams added that Kawam had a “brief stint in our homeless shelter system,” though did not say when. The man accused of lighting her on fire on Dec. 22, Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was taken into custody hours after police disseminated images of a suspect in the shocking Sunday morning attack on a train stopped in Brooklyn's Coney Island. He has since been indicted on murder and arson charges. Identifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her. Adams said at an unrelated press briefing Tuesday that he didn't know more than Kawam's name and New Jersey address, but said authorities had been in contact with her next of kin. “Hearts go out to the family, a horrific incident to have to live through,” Adams said. “It impacts on how New Yorkers feel. But it really reinforces what I’ve been saying: People should not be living on our subway system, they should be in a place of care. No matter where she lived that should not have happened.” Authorities have said they don't believe Kawam and Zapeta knew each other. Federal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the U.S. illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support. Prosecutors allege both Kawam and Zapeta were on the stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station when Zapeta approached a sleeping Kawam and set her clothing on fire. He then fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned, prosecutors said. Kawam was pronounced dead at the scene. Zapeta was arrested later that day after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students. Zapeta has yet to enter a plea in the case and remains jailed. He was not present at a court hearing Friday where his indictment was announced and his attorney declined to comment afterward. Prosecutor Ari Rottenberg said at the hearing that Zapeta told police he drinks a lot of liquor and doesn’t know what happened. He did, however, identify himself in photos and surveillance video showing the fire being lit, Rottenberg said. “This was a malicious deed,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said after the Friday hearing. ___ This story corrects Kawam's age based on updated information from the police.

       " 'Democrats are to blame for record homelessness By Zachary Faria Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print December 31, 2024 2:11 pm Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print The Department of Housing and Urban Development has found there is now a record number of homeless people in the United States. Liberal policies are primarily to blame. The homelessness census report found that homelessness in the U.S. increased by 18% to a record number of 771,480. That 18% increase from 2023 to 2024 is made worse when you know that homelessness increased by 19% from 2007 to 2024, making the jump from 2023 to 2024 responsible for nearly the entire increase over the last 17 years. BREAKING NEWS – Today HUD released data showing homelessness has reached a record high in the U.S. in 2024, with over 120K more documented homeless compared to last year. 771,480 people experienced homelessness on a single night this past January, including 150,000 children. pic.twitter.com/f1NBe1ARK1 — Torraine Walker (@TorraineWalker) December 27, 2024 Of the six states that saw an increase of 25% or more in their homeless population, just two are run by Republicans. Alabama’s homeless population went up by nearly 1,300 people, though the state’s homelessness rate remains relatively low compared to the rest of the country, while West Virginia, which gained 363 homeless people, still has a better homelessness rate than many of its neighbors. The other four states are bastions of Democratic governance: Colorado, an increase of 4,276; Massachusetts, an increase of 10,219; Illinois, an increase of 13,885; and New York, an increase of a whopping 54,819. Those four states happen to be the ones that have encouraged illegal immigrants to cross the border, leading Texas to send those illegal immigrants their way. New York City and Illinois have been overwhelmed by illegal immigrants, leading to homeless shelter restrictions and a lack of city resources to deal with that crisis or other city functions. Massachusetts had to deploy National Guard members to serve as glorified maids at hotels housing newly arrived illegal immigrants. Colorado is now home to the unofficial American headquarters of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The failed immigration policies of the Biden administration, as well as those four states actively encouraging illegal immigrants to swarm the border with promises of “sanctuary,” are behind the massive surges in the homeless population. California, the model state for Democratic failures in governance on homelessness and everything else, rounds out the top five states with the biggest total increase in homeless people, though Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) boasted that California’s rate of homelessness increased at less than the national average. Newsom also said CalMatters ’ s homeless estimation for California was unreliable and unverified in an effort to downplay it, only for HUD’s numbers to be even higher than what CalMatters had. From the Biden administration’s failed immigration policies to sanctuary states and cities inviting people they can’t house to California’s general incompetence, Democratic policies are the chief driver of the record homelessness we are seeing today. If you don’t think this problem can continue to get worse, you aren’t familiar with the stubbornness of Democrats in power in the face of their own massive failures.

Latin Times Steve Bannon welcomed growing tensions between the MAGA movement and Elon Musk over immigration policy, particularly regarding the H-1B visa program, calling the \"escalation\" a positive development. On his WarRoom podcast, Bannon criticized Musk\\'s support for the H-1B program , a visa category that allows skilled foreign workers to fill U.S. jobs, arguing it undercuts American workers and goes against President-elect Donald Trump\\'s immigration agenda, Mediaite reported . \"It\\'s unfortunate that things have escalated the way they have escalated, but we\\'ll see,\" fellow Musk critic Laura Loomer said during the discussion. Loomer, who has faced account restrictions on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), accused Musk of \"abuse\" toward the MAGA base, citing inflammatory comments such as calling critics \"retarded\" and urging them to \"go f*** yourself in the face.\" Bannon, however, dismissed Musk\\'s insults and took a combative stance, saying, \"I think escalation\\'s good. When an enemy\\'s in retreat, fix bayonets and pursue.\" He added that the MAGA movement has become resilient after years of political conflict. \"We\\'re battle-hardened [after] over a decade of fighting,\" Bannon said. \"People are — hey, it\\'s nothing.\" Bannon has long advocated for the elimination of the H-1B program, while Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have defended it as a solution to a skills gap in the U.S. workforce.

       "  'text': 'Chief Justice John Roberts devoted his annual report on the state of the judiciary Saturday to the role of lower court judges who he called “selfless, patriotic and brave individuals.” “This is no job for impulsive, timid or inattentive souls,” Roberts wrote in the report, which sheds light each year on an issue the chief justice believes should receive the public’s attention. Roberts’ message comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to fill a Supreme Court vacancy and reshape the lower courts. There are currently more than a hundred vacancies at the district and appellate court level nationwide, according to the administrative office of the US courts. In past years, the chief’s reports have emphasized issues such as judicial pay, budget cuts and recusal rules. Roberts, a keen student of the history of the Supreme Court, almost always manages to weave in historical references. This year’s report details George Washington’s role in appointing 13 original United States district judges, a list that included a general in the Revolutionary War, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a poet and musician. “These individuals are not well known in our era, but they launched the new system of United States District Courts and set the course for the important role those institutions would come to play in the new republic,” Roberts wrote. Turning to present day judges, Roberts said that they are not often the focus of public attention but that they play a “crucial role.” “You might be asking,” Roberts wrote, “why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours, exacting skill and intense devotion — while promising high stress, solitary confinement and guaranteed criticism.” Roberts continued: “The answer lies in the rewards of public service.” Congress has authorized 673 district court judgeships. Although Roberts said that “unlike politicians, they work largely outside of the public eye,” he did not mention the fact that sometimes district court judges find themselves in the middle of a political storm, as when district court Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Southern District of Texas temporarily stopped the Obama administration’s executive actions on immigration in 2015. The programs at issue never did go into effect after a deadlocked Supreme Court blocked them earlier this year. On the current court, only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has served as a district court judge. Trump’s list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees is dominated by appellate court judges and state Supreme Court justices but it also includes Judge Amul Thapar of the Eastern District of Kentucky, the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

       "  'text': 'Big Dreams and Hidden Harms Post author: Edward A. Fallone Post published: December 31, 2016 Post category: Federal Law & Legal System / Immigration Law / Political Processes & Rhetoric / Public Post comments: 3 Comments One of the first choices that the Trump Administration will face after the upcoming inauguration is what to do about the “Dreamers.” \\xa0The name Dreamer has been used both to refer specifically to the young adults currently participating in the Deferred Action Childhood Arrival program (DACA) and, more generally, to any undocumented residents of the United States who were brought to this country by their parents when they were minors. It is not difficult to be sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers.\\xa0 As undocumented residents of the United States, they were subject to immediate deportation under the law as it existed prior to 2012.\\xa0 However, these longtime residents of the United States often had little memory of their birth country and may not have spoken any language other than English.\\xa0 They grew up in the United States, and attended U.S. schools, and as a result they share the same hopes and dreams of any native born young adult.\\xa0 Moreover, they were not morally complicit in their parents’ decision to enter the United States.\\xa0 Prior to 2012, approximately 2 million people essentially found themselves trapped in a form of limbo – feeling American, unconnected to any foreign country, and yet unable to work lawfully in the United States or to plan for their future. Legislation was first introduced in Congress in 2001 to resolve this situation and to permit these persons to obtain legal residence in the United States.\\xa0 Titled the Development Relief and Education of Alien Minors Act (or DREAM Act), this first bill and similar versions introduced in subsequent years were designed to create a 6-year pathway to permanent legal residency.\\xa0 To be eligible under the DREAM Act, a young adult had to have been brought to the United States at a young age, was required to be a college graduate or a military veteran (or be currently enrolled or enlisted), and could not have a criminal record.\\xa0 The DREAM Act and its successor bills boasted bipartisan support but never passed both houses of Congress, either as a standalone bill or as a component part of a comprehensive immigration reform package. Frustrated by congressional inaction, President Obama chose to extend relief to the Dreamers in the form of a Presidential Directive. In 2012, the President issued a directive to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to exercise prosecutorial discretion in order to defer the possible deportation of qualifying Dreamers.\\xa0 On June 15, 2012, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano issued a memorandum setting forth the manner in which prosecutorial discretion would be exercised under the Deferred Action Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. Individuals are eligible to apply for DACA if they: Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; Came to the United States before reaching their 16th birthday; Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time; Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making their request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS; Had no lawful status on June 15, 2012; Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general education development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; and Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. Benefits of DACA include: The ability to apply for a drivers’ license (which is renewable as long as their DACA status is current); A social security card with a number that can be used for work authorization purposes only; A temporary “reprieve” from deportation; and The possibility of obtaining “advance parole”, or permission from the federal government to exit and re-enter the US lawfully during a specified period of time. Approximately 740,000 people have applied for and received DACA status. For the first time in their lives, they can work lawfully, and can confidently make significant purchases such as homes, cars, or an investment in higher education. The constitutional authority of the President to act via Presidential Directive is not in question.\\xa0 The DACA policy was not created via an Executive Order, as is often incorrectly asserted, and does not exceed the scope of directives issued by previous presidents .\\xa0 In November 2014, President Obama issued a series of Executive Orders expanding the DACA program and creating a similar program for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children.\\xa0 That second presidential initiative has proven more controversial and is currently tied up in federal court. Because the DACA program exists as a policy directive and not as a congressional law, it can be changed or eliminated by a future executive action.\\xa0 During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump pledged to end the program (although he has softened his tone since the election).\\xa0 Understandably, Dreamers across the country are now anxious and fearful about the possible actions of a Trump Administration. The Trump Administration could take three different approaches to the DACA program.\\xa0 First, President Trump could end the program immediately by issuing a new Presidential Directive.\\xa0 Obviously, this option would be the most disruptive to the lives of the Dreamers.\\xa0 They would immediately lose their jobs and would likely have to abandon their career ambitions.\\xa0 Second, he could allow current enrollees to maintain their benefits but act to prohibit any renewals or new applications.\\xa0 Under this scenario, current enrollees would continue in the program until the end of their 2 year benefit period, and the program would gradually die out over time.\\xa0 This second option would at least give the Dreamers some time work lawfully as they prepare for their change in status.\\xa0 Finally, President Trump could allow the DACA program to continue merely by doing nothing.\\xa0 He might pursue this option if it looked like Congress was on the verge of taking legislative action to pass a law that created similar benefits for the Dreamers. Indeed, it is very possible that Congress will finally take legislative action in 2017 in order to create a statutory solution to the situation of the Dreamers.\\xa0 In the aftermath of the presidential election, a bipartisan effort to pass a legislative equivalent to the DACA program seems to have gained momentum .\\xa0 Of course, Congress could have taken action to address the plight of the Dreamers 16 years ago.\\xa0 Why might bipartisan action be possible now, when over a decade of congressional impotence on the issue ultimately inspired a frustrated President Obama to use his executive authority in order to address the problem? The answer, of course, is politics.\\xa0 First of all, a standalone bill to benefit the Dreamers has been held hostage until now by legislators in Congress seeking a broader overhaul of the entire immigration system.\\xa0 Support for the Dreamers has always been one of the few truly bipartisan aspects of the congressional effort to enact a Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill.\\xa0 So long as there was some hope that a broader immigration bill might pass Congress, advocates of the broader bill opposed separate legislation to provide a lawful status for the Dreamers.\\xa0 Reform advocates feared that carving out the Dreamer provisions into a separate bill would lessen congressional support for the entire package.\\xa0 However, now that support for Comprehensive Immigration Reform has emerged as Republican kryptonite – fatal to the election hopes of any Republican candidate for office – there is no longer any rationale for holding Dreamer legislation hostage to a larger overhaul of the immigration laws. Second, the Trump Administration will seek to avoid taking early actions that play into public fears of a divisive and punitive presidency.\\xa0 Any action to immediately inflict harm on sympathetic long-time residents of the United States will hurt Trump’s public image, and serve to embolden protests against other Trump initiatives.\\xa0 The Trump Administration can afford to take a “wait and see” approach to the Dreamers while it directs its immigration initiatives against less sympathetic segments of the undocumented population. In sum, the clear and direct harm that any change in current executive policy would inflict on an identifiable group of individuals actually makes it less likely that President Trump will act.\\xa0 The Dreamers are so obviously vulnerable, and the connection between the action taken by Trump and the harm to that group so clear, that President Trump would be unable to avoid accountability for his action. The irony here is that by being so publicly helpless, the Dreamers are actually protected from punitive action. In contrast, it is very likely that the Trump Administration will spare the Dreamers whilst simultaneously pursuing a variety of policies that cause very real but hidden harms to a less readily identifiable group of victims.\\xa0 Proposals to delay the retirement age for Social Security recipients, to decrease future benefit levels , and to replace Medicare with a more expensive private insurance program are all currently under serious consideration in Washington.\\xa0 If enacted, all of these initiatives will reduce the financial safety net for older Americans in ways that have a negative impact on people’s lives.\\xa0 However, the harm inflicted by these changes will be diffuse and hard to quantify, in the form of reduced benefit levels over multiple years, unlike the immediate and direct harm that the Dreamers would face.\\xa0 Moreover, the persons affected by such changes would be defined by their future economic status (middle class and lower income seniors) and therefore would be less readily identifiable to the general public than 740,000 Dreamers.\\xa0 Finally, the connection between the changes made to Social Security and Medicare and the responsibility of any one politician will be hidden in a haze of collective action and finger pointing.\\xa0 It is easy for politicians to support policies that inflict financial harm when they can avoid accountability for their actions. There may well be a legislative reprieve for the Dreamers in 2017.\\xa0 But there is more than one kind of American dream.\\xa0 Many of us dream of financial security in our old age.\\xa0 That may well prove to be the dream most at risk in a Trump Administration.

There has been no official announcement from the Trump Administration cancelling the DACA program, and it is unclear whether immigration officials have the legal authority to deport an individual currently receiving DACA benefits (and without a criminal record) unless and until the DACA program is officially ended. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/illegal-immigration-daca-arrest.html Leave a Reply Cancel reply Comment Enter your name or username to comment Enter your email address to comment Enter your website URL (optional) Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

       "  'text': 'POLITICS Republicans launch all-out social media campaign to woo Latino voters By Elizabeth Llorente , Fox News Published March 26, 2015 8:30am EDT | Updated January 1, 2017 2:15pm EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email (Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers) (Getty Images) WASHINGTON D.C. – When Ted Cruz first announced that he was running for president earlier this week, he did it via Twitter, where he wrote: “I\\'m running for President and I hope to earn your support!” Hours later, when he announced his candidacy the old fashioned way – in a speech before a crowd – he also released two campaign videos on YouTube, one in English and one in Spanish. This is a glimpse into the multimedia approach to reaching Latinos that Republicans plan to make a core part of the 2016 presidential campaign. “Hispanics are leading users of digital media,” said Ruth Guerra, director of Hispanic media for the Republican National Committee, “and their median age is 27.” That’s a whole 10 years younger than the general population’s median age of 37, and it’s critical, Guerra said, to reach them through the technology that is central to their lives. Republicans are also looking to woo Latinos by going right to their communities, something that GOP candidates have not done nearly as much as Democrats have. Since the last election, they have kept Republican campaign offices in 11 states where there are significant Latino populations. “The Hispanic community is about trust and being face-to-face,” said Guerra in an interview on Capitol Hill with Fox News Latino. “We’re getting candidates to go to the communities, to the events, to engage with Hispanics, Otherwise, Hispanics are going to hear about Republicans from Democrats.” The DNC is also coming out with a strategy of its own. It is launching the \"Hispanic Caucus,\" and ambitious get-out the vote effort to bolster Latino support for their party\\'s presidential nominee. DNC officials declined to give more details about the caucus. If successful, it could be repeated in other battleground states. The 2012 presidential election was a wake-up call for the GOP. President Barack Obama swept up 71 percent of the Latino vote, and his GOP challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney got a paltry 27 percent. Many surveys of Latino voters revealed that they viewed Republicans as anti-Latino, in no small part because of some harsh rhetoric regarding immigration during the GOP primaries. Romney, political observers have said, remained something of a caricature or enigma to many Latinos that he never was able to overcome. Last year, for the mid-term, Republicans tried different strategies, including making Republican candidates more accessible, and more real, so to speak, to Latino voters. In Central Florida, where Republicans made concerted efforts to court Latinos, two GOP candidates beat Democratic incumbents. One of the victors was GOP candidate Rene Plasencia, a teacher and track coach who won 51 percent of the vote in the congressional district, which has a growing Puerto Rican community. He beat a Democratic incumbent. “They did a lot of Hispanic engagement” with the support of the national RNC, Guerra said, “and they defeated Democrat incumbents.” Republicans applied a similar approach in Colorado, where U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, a conservative Republican, beat Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Udall in one of the most closely watched races in the nation. Gardner won 51 percent of the vote, and Udall got 43 percent with 71 percent of the precincts reporting. “We got them out to community events,” Guerra said about Gardner and U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, who beat the Democratic challenger, Andrew Romanoff, by a large margin. Coffman and Romanoff made national headlines when they participated in Colorado’s first such all-Spanish political debate on TV. Coffman, who was taking Spanish lessons, agreed to take part even though Romanoff is fluent and, thus, had an edge. “Coffman still is taking Spanish classes,” Guerra said. Democrats balk at the GOP’s plans to improve their image among Latinos. They say Latinos will not be fooled by cosmetics. If the basic positions of Republicans continue to be against comprehensive immigration reform and raising the minimum wage and the Affordable Care Act, they will continue to alienate the country’s fastest voting bloc, said Holly Shulman, the national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. “Issues matter,” Shulman said to Fox News Latino. “The reality is people are going to make their selection based on what candidates believe.” When the GOP tells Latinos that theirs is the party that shares with them such things as strong family values, Shulman said, Latinos contrast the rhetoric with the actions GOP lawmakers have taken to deport more people and separate families. “Republicans in the last few months have tried to shut down the Department of Homeland Security because they wanted to stop a policy that would keep families together,” she said.

       "  'text': 'POLITICS Two Latinos in the short list for retiring Sen. Harry Reid\\'s Senate seat By Elizabeth Llorente , Fox News Published March 27, 2015 5:35pm EDT | Updated January 1, 2017 2:15pm EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email Two people emerging as possible candidates to run for retiring veteran Sen. Harry Reid’s seat in Nevada are Latinos — Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval and former Democratic state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto. Shortly after he announced his retirement Friday, Reid, who is 75, endorsed Cortez Masto to run for his seat. In an interview with KNPR, Nevada’s public radio station, Reid said: \"Whoever runs against Catherine, I think, will be a loser.” “I hope she decides to run,” he added. “If she does, I’m going to help her.” Having Reid’s blessing should make her a solid contender for the Democratic nomination. In the GOP field, Sandoval has received encouragement to run in years past. National Republican leaders had seen him as someone who was capable of mounting a formidable challenge to Reid in a Senate race. Whether Sandoval, who won re-election last year with a hefty 70 percent of the vote, decides to throw his hat in the ring is uncertain. He has said he is not interested in running for the Senate and that his priority is to serve out his term as governor. Nearly 27 percent of Nevada’s population is Latino, according to the 2010 Census, making the Hispanic share there the fifth largest in the nation. Some 16 percent of all of Nevada’s eligible voters are Hispanic, the sixth largest Hispanic statewide eligible voter share nationally. Almost 40 percent of the Silver State’s Latinos are eligible to vote. On Friday, many Latinos praised Reid as an advocate of causes dear to them. “Senator Harry Reid has been one of the fiercest champions for the Latino community in the upper chamber,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Chairwoman Linda T. Sánchez in a statement. “From championing the DREAM Act to comprehensive immigration reform and countless other Latino priorities, Senator Reid has always fought for America’s working families. During his tenure, Senator Reid empowered the Latino community to be a strong voice in Nevada. Though the state will lose a much beloved Senator, we know that the Latino community will continue playing a critical role.” “When you combine influence and conviction, Harry Reid has been by far the biggest support of the Latino community on Capitol Hill,” said Jose Parra, a Democratic strategist who was Reid’s deputy communications director for six years. “He had the ability to get things done. He believed in doing the right thing and not what was politically expedient.” When Reid ran in 2010, some in the party warned him that his support for the DREAM Act – a national measure that called for providing undocumented immigrants who came as minors a path to legal status – would not sit well with white and Independent voters in Nevada. He forged ahead anyway, pushing for the DREAM Act, and Latinos came out to vote for Reid in droves. “The polls didn’t take into account a large Latino turnout,” Parra said. “They came out for him in overwhelming numbers – in a midterm election, as if it were a presidential election.” As Democratic leader, Reid thrived on behind-the-scenes wrangling. He guided the Senate through a crippling recession and the GOP takeover of the House in the 2010 elections, which sparked years of bitter partisan battles and congressional gridlock. Even from his post in the minority, Reid leveraged Senate rules to exert steely control. He held his 46-member caucus together against attempts by Republicans to pass legislation undoing Obama\\'s executive actions on immigration, forcing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to back down, and House Speaker John Boehner to follow. The episode left some House Republicans complaining bitterly that Reid might as well still be majority leader. Some speculate that with Reid’s retirement, pressure may mount again on Sandoval to run for his seat. A poll last year showed Sandoval beating Reid in a 2016 Senate race 53-43 percent. Sandoval last year helped Republicans regain control of both houses of the state legislature. To be sure, he has plenty of critics, especially for pushing a tax increase to help subsidize education. Cortez Masto was considered a strong candidate for lieutenant governor and governor in 2014, but did not run. Efforts are underway by both parties to motivate Latinos in Nevada to vote in the 2016 presidential election. Reid had been focused on working with the national Democratic party to boost turnout among Latinos. Low Latino turnout in last November’s mid-term elections were seen as one reason Republican candidates did well there. For his part, Sandoval lavished praise on Reid on Friday. “He is one of Nevada’s native sons, a pioneer of the West who has always worked tirelessly to fight for Nevadans with a gritty determination,” Sandoval said. “Sen. Reid has been an influential voice in Congress on behalf of Nevada’s interests, particularly on issues such as Yucca Mountain and renewable energy development. His service to Nevada as a state legislator, lieutenant governor, congressman and senator spans almost half a century and his legacy will last for generations.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

       "  'text': 'POLITICS Sen. Ted Cruz skips Hispanic Chamber of Commerce summit, displeases Latinos in D.C. By Elizabeth Llorente , Fox News Published March 26, 2015 5:01pm EDT | Updated January 2, 2017 8:36pm EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Washington, D.C. – The president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce questioned in a meeting with reporters Thursday whether Sen. Ted Cruz’s snubbing of the group’s annual summit this week marked an attempt to avoid Latinos as he runs for president. “Ted Cruz chose not to come,” said a visibly displeased Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. “I hope it is not indicative that he’s backing away from the Hispanic community in order to get through the [GOP] primary.” Other presidential hopefuls such as Senators Rand Paul, R-Ky, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also did not speak at the summit. But Palomarez said they had scheduling conflicts and that they had good relationships with the chamber, joining them at events other times of the year and that both men have attended past Hispanic Chamber summits. Speakers at the summit on Thursday included Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, Reps. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado and Carlos Curbelo, R-Florida. On the Democratic side, speakers included Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Linda Sanchez, both of California. “If you’re trying to get to the White House without openly trying to engage the Hispanic community,” Palomarez said, “you’re not going to get there.” To be sure, Cruz is an outspoken supporter of small businesses, who make up the bulk of USHCC’s membership. In this week’s announcement that he is running for president, the Texas Republican asked Americans to \"imagine\" what he believed a conservative administration could accomplish. \"Think just how different the world would be. Imagine instead of economic stagnation, booming economic growth,\" Cruz said. \"Instead of small businesses going out of business in record numbers, imagine small businesses growing and prospering. Imagine young people coming out of school with four, five, six job offers.\" Efforts to get a comment from Cruz’s office about Palomarez\\'s statements were unsuccessful. In past presidential election cycles, the GOP’s conservative base has held increasing sway to the point of being able to shape the issues that arise in debates during the GOP primaries. Republican presidential hopefuls have had to perform a sort of high-wire act, trying to get enough conservative support to do well during the GOP primary, but then appeal to a broader electorate – which includes crossover Democrats and Independents, besides moderate Republicans – for the general election. While Cruz could do well in the primaries if conservatives retain their influence at that stage of the 2016 presidential campaign, many political observers say that his ironclad views against such things as Obamacare and immigration policies that would give breaks to undocumented immigrants will hurt him in the general election. Cruz’s spokespersons in the past have taken exception to suggestions that he tries to distance himself from his roots. Cruz is Cuban on his father’s side. Years ago, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was quoted in published reports as saying Cruz was not a true Hispanic because he did not support programs and policies that Latinos largely favor. Richardson later downplayed his comments. Cruz supporters also said that it was unfair to expect all Latinos to hold the same positions or behave a certain way to prove their ethnic pride. On the same day Cruz announced his candidacy for president, he released a Spanish-language campaign video on YouTube that touted his belief in the American Dream. The video, which used a Spanish-speaking narrator, omitted any mention of the senator’s opposition to President Obama’s Affordable Care Act and comprehensive immigration reform, which were both mentioned in the English-language campaign video. Palomarez said he has had regular, productive discussions with GOP leaders in Congress about immigration and small business. He said he realizes that it is important to be bipartisan and have a rapport with both parties in order to successfully push for legislation and programs that benefit Latinos. \"The Hispanic community, bar none, is important to the U.S. economy,\" Palomarez said. \"Immigration reform is an economic imperative for the well-being of this nation.\" Palomarez said he met with Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, on Wednesday to discuss Latinos and the economy and that the lawmaker understands the community\\'s critical role in the Lone Star\\'s small business world. He also has met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, but that discussion went less well, Palomarez conceded. \"Mitch is not as far along as John.\" More from Politics 30 mins ago The Super Bowl team Trump may not be rooting for on Sunday 1 hour ago Rubio scores key wins for Trump immigration agenda with blitz through Latin America 1 hour ago Trump’s cuts to foreign aid could benefit US position in Iran negotiations, expert says 1 hour ago Trudeau says Trump is serious about Canada becoming 51st state: reports Fox News Politics Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks at the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) Legislative Conference and Presidential Forum in Washington. Cruz plans to announce Monday, March 23, 2015, that he is running for president. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign criticized as ridiculous an assertion that the presidential candidate skipped a major Latino gathering in Washington D.C. to which he was invited because he wants to keep Hispanics at a distance. In a meeting with reporters Thursday, Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said that Cruz “chose not to come.” He added: “I hope it is not indicative that he’s backing away from the Hispanic community in order to get through the [GOP] primary.” Rick Tyler, the national spokesman for the Cruz campaign, said the notion that the Texas Republican is avoiding Latinos and his roots is baseless. He said Cruz regularly speaks with admiration of his immigrant father, Rafael Cruz, who fled Cuba. Tyler said that the scheduling of the summit, which was held Wednesday and Thursday, coincided with an extremely busy time for Cruz, who announced on Monday that he is running for president. “The assertion is ridiculous,” Tyler said of Palomarez’s comment. “It was simply a scheduling conflict… We had to keep our commitments limited” because of the launching of the presidential campaign. Other presidential hopefuls such as Senators Rand Paul, R-Ky, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also did not speak at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s annual legislative summit. But Palomarez said they had scheduling conflicts and that they had good relationships with the chamber, joining them at events other times of the year and that both men have attended past Hispanic Chamber summits. “If you’re trying to get to the White House without openly trying to engage the Hispanic community,” Palomarez said, “you’re not going to get there.” Tyler, however, said Cruz is proud of his Cuban roots on his father’s side, adding that the senator referred to his Latino roots in the speech launching his campaign on Monday. “He’s the son of an immigrant, and he talks about it in his speeches,” Tyler said. “He talks about his position on immigration. He supports legal immigration, but he also suggested we need to control our borders to be fair to [legal] American workers, including Hispanic workers.” In past presidential election cycles, the GOP’s conservative base has held increasing sway to the point of being able to shape the issues that arise in debates during the GOP primaries. Republican presidential hopefuls have had to perform a sort of high-wire act, trying to get enough conservative support to do well during the GOP primary, but then appeal to a broader electorate – which includes crossover Democrats and Independents, besides moderate Republicans – for the general election. While Cruz could do well in the primaries if conservatives retain their influence at that stage of the 2016 presidential campaign, many political observers say that his ironclad views against such things as Obamacare and immigration policies that would give breaks to undocumented immigrants will hurt him in the general election. Tyler said many Latinos share Cruz's support for securing borders and controlling immigration. “Sen. Cruz is trying to get a rational legal immigration system,” Tyler said. “You can’t do that unless you first have the will to control the border.” Speakers at the summit on Thursday included Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, Reps. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado and Carlos Curbelo, R-Florida. On the Democratic side, speakers included Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Linda Sanchez, both of California.

       "  'text': 'As 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts, deadly attacks at gatherings and deaths of legendary celebrities. How people are ushering in the new year: AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. The glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbor and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. Wilder was also honored as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colors while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. “This year, sadly, we saw the loss of many music and entertainment legends around the world,” fireworks show co-producer Catherine Flanagan said. “So celebrating their music as part of Sydney New Year’s Eve fireworks displays is an opportunity to reflect on the year that has been and what the future may hold.” TURKEY New Year’s celebrations turned deadly when an armed assailant believed to have been dressed as Santa Claus opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul, killing dozens of people. Istanbul’s governor said at least 35 people were killed and 40 others were wounded. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as street vendors. Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people. Neslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighborhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” “2016 affected everyone badly,” she said. BRAZIL More than 2 million people have welcomed 2017 at Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach. Twelve minutes of fireworks amazed many of the more than 860,000 tourists who traveled to Rio for the party. The event was more modest than last year due to the city’s recession. Still, tourists and Brazilians enjoyed a festival of sounds, including two sets of drums from popular samba schools. LAS VEGAS More than 300,000 visitors are expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year’s Eve celebration. Nightclubs are pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city’s celebrity chefs have crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts. An eight-minute fireworks show will kick off at the stroke of midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos. Federal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square. FBI and Secret Service agents will work alongside local police departments that are putting all hands on deck for the big night. GERMANY In Berlin the mood was more somber than celebratory. “I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. Two Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. Walking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” Birgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her 3-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” Nicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. “I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. Later, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. Using the hashtag “(hash)nichtlustig” — meaning “not funny” — Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating (hash)Welcome2017 with us.” RUSSIA President Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. “Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. New Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. “I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. “We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. LONDON A beefed-up security presence throughout London and Britain’s other major cities did nothing to squelch raucous New Year celebrations highlighted by a breathtaking fireworks display over the River Thames that began just after the Big Ben tower chimed midnight. Police had added overt and covert personnel to patrol crowded areas, and some barriers were put in place to prevent vehicle attacks. Britain had a tumultuous year, with a June vote to leave the European Union followed by the resignation of the prime minister, but Warren Male and Natasha Lewis said they looked back on 2016 with fondness. “Because we’ve been together,” Lewis said. PARIS Tourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. “It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, 42, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. “At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything,” she added. Some were happy to say goodbye to 2016. “It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, 38, from Lyon. Others found a bright side. “My hope for 2017 is that we solve all the problems with the migrants here in France, and see the end of (President) Francois Hollande,” said Marc Valli, 35, from Paris. “We need someone who can sort out immigration as president.” Hollande, who is not standing for re-election in the upcoming ballot, used his last New Year’s address praise his country’s resilience in the face of deadly attacks in Nice and Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. Hollande said French people they could be proud for continuing “to live, work, go out, move around and cherish … freedom.” Police were out in force — with over 10,000 deployed in the French capital alone — and authorities said that “the passage to the New Year will take place in the THE VATICAN Pope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. Francis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” More than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” JAPAN Temple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. “I feel this sense of duality,” said Kami Miyamoto, 21, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, who traveled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. “The world is heading toward conservative insular policies,” she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. “We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.” One of the most memorable experiences for Miyamoto in 2016 was a three-week study program in South Korea. She was surprised and moved by the friendship she formed with South Korean students, and she has decided to focus her studies on relations with South Korea. “Studying about the U.S. and Europe seems to be about looking at the past, but East Asian studies are focusing on the future,” she said. Miyamoto’s mother is preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. CHINA Residents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, were passing New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. The Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited altogether. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. Beijing police also said countdowns, light shows, lotteries and other organized activities will not be held in popular shopping districts such as Sanlitun and Guomao. Beijing police advised citizens to avoid crowded areas, closely watch elderly relatives and children, and be aware of exit routes in venues. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his annual New Year’s Eve address that his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. SOUTH KOREA Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. The evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. The city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s World War II military. Park Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. “So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” INDIA For most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. The western city of Mumbai will host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. “2016 was boring but Modi brought about a twister near the end,” 18-year-old student Jugal Jadhwani said of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in early November. “It’s good for India,” he said. It was a sentiment echoed by 42-year old Prasoon Verma. “2016 was good and with demonetization 2017 should be good for the Indian economy and India should move to the digital age,” he said. PHILIPPINES The Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. Powerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. Duterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. Before New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. ROMANIA New Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. Former Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, traveling to the mountain town of Sinaia, told The Associated Press that Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. “People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” Early Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats — a New Year symbol — while waving wands made of dried flowers. One tradition was squelched this year. Police banned masked revelers in the northeastern village of Ruginoasa from staging a traditional fight between young men involving whips and bats after several people were injured a few years ago. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES In Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the 828-meter (2,716-foot) Burj Khalifa. The show was also streamed live online. There was no repeat of last year’s excitement, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at The Address Downtown, a 63-story skyscraper nearby. The high-rise tower still remains under repair. Just before the fireworks, private security guards stood every 50 meters (55 yards) as metal barriers blocked off sidewalks to keep the streets around the Burj Khalifa clear for roaming emergency vehicles, their strobe lights flashing in the darkness. While 2016 brought challenges across the world, those gathered to watch the fireworks in Dubai instead chose to focus on the positive. For Ina Dumdum, 33, of Manila, Philippines, 2016 brought a new job in Abu Dhabi and greater economic security. Wearing a pink pair of do-it-yourself “Happy New Year” rabbit ears on her head,she smiled while saying she hoped for a baby in the New Year. “2016 was prosperity,” she said. Tony Ngalande, 38, of Lilongwe, Malawi, also saw success in his automobile importing business. However, “2016 was full of a lot of surprises,” he said, mentioning the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. and the British vote to leave the European Union. Ngalande laughed when asked if those surprises could portend anything negative for the new year. “So far so good,” he said with a smile. NEW YORK CITY New Year’s Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before the glittering crystal ball was to drop. Officials estimated as many as a million celebrants would descend upon the Crossroads of the World, braving cold temperatures and strong winds to bring in the New Year amid heavy police protection. Stefania Moran, from Puebla, Mexico, and five friends traveled to New York to secure a coveted spot in one of 35 metal pens where re-entry is prohibited. “I’ve always wanted to come to New York, and this is one of the must-dos before you die,” she said. Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard. This year, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has the honor of pushing the Waterford crystal button that begins a 60-second countdown to 2017. Mariah Carey is the headline performer in Times Square for “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” on ABC. FINLAND CENTENARY Finland has kicked off celebrations for 100 years of independence from Russia. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Helsinki for a concert and a huge fireworks display to celebrate the beginning of festivities marking its independence. Throughout 2017 there will be hundreds of events in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million, from films, dance parties and environment-related events to concerts and activities linked to its renowned sauna tradition. Celebrations will culminate on Dec. 6, the day Finnish Parliament declared independence in 1917 amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday congratulated Finland for its centenary in a phone conversation with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. MEXICO CITY Thousands of people in Mexico City are expected to turn out for a New Year’s Eve concert at the Monument to Independence, better known as The Angel. Workers spent several days setting up a stage and a booming sound system along a stretch of the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard. Streets were blocked off in the area, and 2,000 police officers were on hand for security. The lineup includes a mix of Latin pop and balladeer Jorge “Coque” Muniz, with cumbia band Los Angeles Azules heating things up after a midnight fireworks show.

As 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. How people are ushering in the new year: AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. The glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbor and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. Wilder was also honored as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colors while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. “This year, sadly, we saw the loss of many music and entertainment legends around the world,” fireworks show co-producer Catherine Flanagan said. “So celebrating their music as part of Sydney New Year’s Eve fireworks displays is an opportunity to reflect on the year that has been and what the future may hold.” ___ LAS VEGAS More than 300,000 visitors are expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year’s Eve celebration. Nightclubs are pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city’s celebrity chefs have crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts. An eight-minute fireworks show will kick off at the stroke of midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos. Federal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square. FBI and Secret Service agents will work alongside local police departments that are putting all hands on deck for the big night. ___ GERMANY In Berlin the mood was more somber than celebratory. “I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. Two Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. Walking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” Birgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her 3-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” Nicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. “I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. Later, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. Using the hashtag “#nichtlustig” — meaning “not funny” — Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.” ___ TURKEY Neslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighborhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” “2016 affected everyone badly,” she said, referring to major attacks that hit Turkey in the past year. The restaurant, adorned with snowflakes and tiny decorative lights for the evening, will have fewer people for dinner. “There is a serious gap between 2015 and 2016 in terms of business, people are going out less,” Dogruol said, adding that she expects more people to come for drinks. At a commemoration for the 45 people killed in twin bombings on Dec. 10 in Istanbul, 38-year-old Murat Manoglu hoped for a better year ahead. “We lived through terrible days, we have lost many martyrs, many households suffered,” he said. Security measures were heightened in major Turkish cities. Traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, will be closed, police said. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Friday. Ankara and Istanbul were targeted by bomb attacks in 2016, killing more than 180 people. Turkey has been in the throes of violence, combatting the Islamic State group, Kurdish militants and a coup attempt blamed on the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. ___ RUSSIA President Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. “Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. New Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. “I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. “We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. ___ PARIS Tourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. “It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, 42, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. “At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything,” she added. Some were happy to say goodbye to 2016. “It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, 38, from Lyon. Others found a bright side. “My hope for 2017 is that we solve all the problems with the migrants here in France, and see the end of (President) Francois Hollande,” said Marc Valli, 35, from Paris. “We need someone who can sort out immigration as president.” Hollande, who is not standing for re-election in the upcoming ballot, used his last New Year’s address praise his country’s resilience in the face of deadly attacks in Nice and Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. Hollande said French people they could be proud for continuing “to live, work, go out, move around and cherish … freedom.” Police were out in force — with over 10,000 deployed in the French capital alone — and authorities said that “the passage to the New Year will take place in the context of a persistent and very high terrorist threat.” ___ THE VATICAN Pope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. Francis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” More than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” ___ JAPAN Temple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. “I feel this sense of duality,” said Kami Miyamoto, 21, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, who traveled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. “The world is heading toward conservative insular policies,” she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. “We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.” One of the most memorable experiences for Miyamoto in 2016 was a three-week study program in South Korea. She was surprised and moved by the friendship she formed with South Korean students, and she has decided to focus her studies on relations with South Korea. “Studying about the U.S. and Europe seems to be about looking at the past, but East Asian studies are focusing on the future,” she said. Miyamoto’s mother is preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. ___ CHINA Residents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, were passing New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. The Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited altogether. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. Beijing police also said countdowns, light shows, lotteries and other organized activities will not be held in popular shopping districts such as Sanlitun and Guomao. Beijing police advised citizens to avoid crowded areas, closely watch elderly relatives and children, and be aware of exit routes in venues. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his annual New Year’s Eve address that his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. ___ SOUTH KOREA Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. The evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. The city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s World War II military. Park Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. “So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” ___ INDIA For most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. The western city of Mumbai will host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. “2016 was boring but Modi brought about a twister near the end,” 18-year-old student Jugal Jadhwani said of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in early November. “It’s good for India,” he said. It was a sentiment echoed by 42-year old Prasoon Verma. “2016 was good and with demonetization 2017 should be good for the Indian economy and India should move to the digital age,” he said. ___ PHILIPPINES The Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. Powerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. Duterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. Before New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. ___ ROMANIA New Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017.

Officials estimate as many as a million celebrants will eventually descend upon the Crossroads of the World, braving cold temperatures and strong winds to bring in the New Year amid heavy police protection. Stefania Moran, 25, from Puebla, Mexico, and five friends — who are nannies for families in the United States — traveled to New York to secure a coveted spot in one of 35 metal pens where re-entry is prohibited. “I’ve always wanted to come to New York and this is one of the must-dos before you die,” she said.

Mariah Carey is the headline performer in Times Square for “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” on ABC.

Expand By Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com UPDATED: August 22, 2019 at 2:31 AM EDT As 2016 drew to a close, revelers around the world bid a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. Here’s a look at how people ushered in the new year: NEW YORK CITY An estimated 1 million people ushered in the new year in Times Square, screaming and kissing as the glittering crystal ball dropped. New Year’s Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before midnight. They braved cold temperatures and strong winds at the Crossroads of the World to greet 2017 amid heavy police protection. Maria Raimilla, from New Jersey, said 2016 was rough. “Everything is going to be new,” she said at midnight. “I just want to find happiness this year and leave all the bad things behind.” Lori Haan, from Tucson, Arizona, and her husband were on their first trip to New York. She said she’s looking forward to what 2017 brings. “This is a great start to the new year,” she said. “We are doing something new and exciting, and I hope that it’s a theme for the rest of the year.” Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone to avoid the possibility of a truck attack like those in Germany and France in recent months. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard. Mariah Carey headlined in Times Square for “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” on ABC. She had technical difficulties during her performance and stopped singing, then she paced the stage and urged the audience to belt out the “Emotions” lyrics instead. “I’m trying to be a good sport here,” she said. Fireworks explode around the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge as New Year’s celebrations get underway in Sydney, Australia, Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016. AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year.

TURKEY New Year’s celebrations turned deadly when an armed assailant believed to have been dressed as Santa Claus opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul , killing dozens of people. Istanbul’s governor said at least 35 people were killed and 40 others were wounded. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as street vendors. Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people. Neslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighborhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” “2016 affected everyone badly,” she said. BRAZIL More than 2 million people have welcomed 2017 at Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach. Twelve minutes of fireworks amazed many of the more than 860,000 tourists who traveled to Rio for the party. The event was more modest than last year due to the city’s recession. Still, tourists and Brazilians enjoyed a festival of sounds, including two sets of drums from popular samba schools. Fireworks light the sky above the Quadriga at the Brandenburg Gate shortly after midnight in Berlin, Germany, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. GERMANY In Berlin the mood was more somber than celebratory. “I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. Two Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. Walking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” Birgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her 3-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” Nicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. “I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. Later, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. Using the hashtag “#nichtlustig” — meaning “not funny” — Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.” Fireworks explode over the Kremlin in Red Square, which was blocked by police, during New Year celebrations in Moscow, Russia, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. New Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. RUSSIA President Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. “Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. New Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. “I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. “We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. The 2017 appears during a firework over the Arc de Triomphe as part of the New Year celebrations on the Champs Elysees, in Paris, France, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. PARIS Tourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. “It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Some people were happy to say goodbye to 2016. “It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, from Lyon. Pope Francis kisses a statue of the Divine Infant as he celebrates a new year’s eve vespers Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016. THE VATICAN Pope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. Francis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” More than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” JAPAN Temple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. Kami Miyamoto, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, traveled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. Miyamoto’s mother was preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. CHINA Residents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, passed New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. The Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his New Year’s Eve address his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. Buddhists light candles during New Year celebrations at Jogye Buddhist temple in Seoul, South Korea, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. SOUTH KOREA Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. The evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. The city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s World War II military. Park Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. “So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” INDIA For most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. The western city of Mumbai was to host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. PHILIPPINES The Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. Powerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. Duterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. Before New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. ROMANIA New Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands of people flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. Former Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, traveling to the mountain town of Sinaia, said Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. “People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” Early Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats, a New Year symbol, while waving wands made of dried flowers. Fireworks explode at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, and surrounding skyscrapers to mark New Year in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES In Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. There was no repeat of the chaos of last year, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at a skyscraper nearby. FINLAND CENTENARY Finland has kicked off celebrations for 100 years of independence from Russia. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Helsinki for a concert and a huge fireworks display to celebrate the beginning of festivities marking its independence. Throughout 2017 there will be hundreds of events in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million, from films, dance parties and environment-related events to concerts and activities linked to its renowned sauna tradition. Celebrations will culminate on Dec. 6, the day Finnish Parliament declared independence in 1917 amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday congratulated Finland for its centenary in a phone conversation with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. MEXICO CITY Thousands of people in Mexico City are expected to turn out for a New Year’s Eve concert at the Monument to Independence, better known as The Angel. Workers spent several days setting up a stage and a booming sound system along a stretch of the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard. Streets were blocked off in the area, and 2,000 police officers were on hand for security. The lineup includes a mix of Latin pop and balladeer Jorge “Coque” Muniz, with cumbia band Los Angeles Azules heating things up after a midnight fireworks show.

Here’s a look at how people ushered in the new year: NEW YORK CITY An estimated 1 million people ushered in the new year in Times Square, screaming and kissing as the glittering crystal ball dropped. New Year’s Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before midnight. They braved cold temperatures and strong winds at the Crossroads of the World to greet 2017 amid heavy police protection. Maria Raimilla, from New Jersey, said 2016 was rough. “Everything is going to be new,” she said at midnight. “I just want to find happiness this year and leave all the bad things behind.” Lori Haan, from Tucson, Arizona, and her husband were on their first trip to New York. She said she’s looking forward to what 2017 brings. “This is a great start to the new year,” she said. “We are doing something new and exciting, and I hope that it’s a theme for the rest of the year.” Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone to avoid the possibility of a truck attack like those in Germany and France in recent months. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard. Mariah Carey headlined in Times Square for “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” on ABC. She had technical difficulties during her performance and stopped singing, then she paced the stage and urged the audience to belt out the “Emotions” lyrics instead. “I’m trying to be a good sport here,” she said. Fireworks explode around the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge as New Year’s celebrations get underway in Sydney, Australia, Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016. AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. The glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbor and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. Wilder was also honored as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colors while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. TURKEY New Year’s celebrations turned deadly when an armed assailant believed to have been dressed as Santa Claus opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul , killing dozens of people.

       "  'text': \"News National News Revelers around the world say hello to 2017, goodbye to a year of conflicts Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) By Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com UPDATED: August 22, 2019 at 2:31 AM EDT As 2016 drew to a close, revelers around the world bid a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. Here’s a look at how people ushered in the new year: NEW YORK CITY An estimated 1 million people ushered in the new year in Times Square, screaming and kissing as the glittering crystal ball dropped. New Year’s Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before midnight. They braved cold temperatures and strong winds at the Crossroads of the World to greet 2017 amid heavy police protection. Maria Raimilla, from New Jersey, said 2016 was rough. “Everything is going to be new,” she said at midnight. “I just want to find happiness this year and leave all the bad things behind.” Lori Haan, from Tucson, Arizona, and her husband were on their first trip to New York. She said she’s looking forward to what 2017 brings. “This is a great start to the new year,” she said. “We are doing something new and exciting, and I hope that it’s a theme for the rest of the year.” Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone to avoid the possibility of a truck attack like those in Germany and France in recent months. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard. Mariah Carey headlined in Times Square for “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” on ABC. She had technical difficulties during her performance and stopped singing, then she paced the stage and urged the audience to belt out the “Emotions” lyrics instead. “I’m trying to be a good sport here,” she said. Fireworks explode around the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge as New Year’s celebrations get underway in Sydney, Australia, Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016. AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. The glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbor and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. Wilder was also honored as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colors while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. TURKEY New Year’s celebrations turned deadly when an armed assailant believed to have been dressed as Santa Claus opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul , killing dozens of people. Istanbul’s governor said at least 35 people were killed and 40 others were wounded. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as street vendors. Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people. Neslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighborhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” “2016 affected everyone badly,” she said. BRAZIL More than 2 million people have welcomed 2017 at Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach. Twelve minutes of fireworks amazed many of the more than 860,000 tourists who traveled to Rio for the party. The event was more modest than last year due to the city’s recession. Still, tourists and Brazilians enjoyed a festival of sounds, including two sets of drums from popular samba schools. Fireworks light the sky above the Quadriga at the Brandenburg Gate shortly after midnight in Berlin, Germany, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. GERMANY In Berlin the mood was more somber than celebratory. “I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. Two Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. Walking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” Birgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her 3-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” Nicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. “I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. Later, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. Using the hashtag “#nichtlustig” — meaning “not funny” — Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.” Fireworks explode over the Kremlin in Red Square, which was blocked by police, during New Year celebrations in Moscow, Russia, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. New Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. RUSSIA President Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. “Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. New Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. “I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. “We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. The 2017 appears during a firework over the Arc de Triomphe as part of the New Year celebrations on the Champs Elysees, in Paris, France, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. PARIS Tourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. “It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Some people were happy to say goodbye to 2016. “It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, from Lyon. Pope Francis kisses a statue of the Divine Infant as he celebrates a new year’s eve vespers Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016. THE VATICAN Pope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. Francis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” More than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” JAPAN Temple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. Kami Miyamoto, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, traveled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. Miyamoto’s mother was preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. CHINA Residents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, passed New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. The Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his New Year’s Eve address his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. Buddhists light candles during New Year celebrations at Jogye Buddhist temple in Seoul, South Korea, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. SOUTH KOREA Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. The evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. The city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s World War II military. Park Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. “So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” INDIA For most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. The western city of Mumbai was to host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. PHILIPPINES The Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. Powerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. Duterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. Before New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. ROMANIA New Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands of people flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. Former Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, traveling to the mountain town of Sinaia, said Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. “People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” Early Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats, a New Year symbol, while waving wands made of dried flowers. Fireworks explode at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, and surrounding skyscrapers to mark New Year in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES In Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. There was no repeat of the chaos of last year, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at a skyscraper nearby. FINLAND CENTENARY Finland has kicked off celebrations for 100 years of independence from Russia. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Helsinki for a concert and a huge fireworks display to celebrate the beginning of festivities marking its independence. Throughout 2017 there will be hundreds of events in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million, from films, dance parties and environment-related events to concerts and activities linked to its renowned sauna tradition. Celebrations will culminate on Dec. 6, the day Finnish Parliament declared independence in 1917 amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday congratulated Finland for its centenary in a phone conversation with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. MEXICO CITY Thousands of people in Mexico City are expected to turn out for a New Year’s Eve concert at the Monument to Independence, better known as The Angel. Workers spent several days setting up a stage and a booming sound system along a stretch of the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard. Streets were blocked off in the area, and 2,000 police officers were on hand for security. The lineup includes a mix of Latin pop and balladeer Jorge “Coque” Muniz, with cumbia band Los Angeles Azules heating things up after a midnight fireworks show.

       "  'text': 'Revelers say hello to 2017, goodbye to a year of conflicts By The Associated Press Posted Dec 31, 2016 04:43:54 AM. Last Updated Jan 1, 2017 02:00:16 AM. This article is more than 5 years old. As 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts, deadly attacks at gatherings and deaths of legendary celebrities. Here’s a look at how people are ushering in the new year: ___ NEW YORK CITY An estimated 1 million people ushered in the new year in Times Square, screaming and kissing as the glittering crystal ball dropped. New Year’s Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before midnight. They braved cold temperatures and strong winds at the Crossroads of the World to greet 2017 amid heavy police protection. Stefania Moran, from Puebla, Mexico, and five friends travelled to New York to secure a coveted spot in one of 35 metal pens where re-entry was prohibited. “I’ve always wanted to come to New York, and this is one of the must-dos before you die,” she said. Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone to avoid the possibility of a truck attack like those in Germany and France in recent months. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard. Mariah Carey was the headline performer in Times Square for “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” on ABC. ___ AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honouring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year.

Still, tourists and Brazilians enjoyed a festival of sounds, including two sets of drums from popular samba schools. ___ LAS VEGAS A decked-out bride and groom walking to a chapel and photo-happy tourists from halfway around the world were among the estimated 300,000 visitors turning out to celebrate the new year Las Vegas style. The city’s celebration features some of the biggest names in music headlining nightclubs and a fireworks show launching from the tops of half a dozen high-rise casinos. Local police joined forces with the National Guard, the Secret Service and FBI agents to protect Sin City on one of its biggest nights of the year. ___ GERMANY In Berlin the mood was more sombre than celebratory. “I don’t like the way politics is going,” Daniel Brandt said. “Fears are being fanned, and people are so angry with each other.” The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants.

This is the whole secret.” ___ LONDON A beefed-up security presence throughout London and Britain’s other major cities did nothing to squelch raucous New Year celebrations highlighted by a breathtaking fireworks display over the River Thames that began just after the Big Ben tower chimed midnight. Police had added overt and covert personnel to patrol crowded areas, and some barriers were put in place to prevent vehicle attacks. Britain had a tumultuous year, with a June vote to leave the European Union followed by the resignation of the prime minister, but Warren Male and Natasha Lewis said they looked back on 2016 with fondness. “Because we’ve been together,” Lewis said. ___ PARIS Tourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. “It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland.

It’s at least the second challenge to the policy that was put forth late last month. Trump signed an executive order last month directing federally run insurance programs, including Medicaid and TRICARE for military families, to exclude coverage for such care. It also calls on the Department of Justice to pursue litigation and legislation to oppose it. Trump also signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.

       "  'text': 'POLITICS Gov. Scott Walker\\'s stance on immigration called into question by rivals and media By Fox News Published March 27, 2015 7:18am EDT | Updated December 31, 2016 6:38pm EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email FILE - In this March 7, 2015 file photo, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker speaks during the Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines, Iowa.  Known for his accessibility and willingness to always be available to take questions, even after the most routine appearances, Walker has suddenly become much harder to reach as he ramps up for a likely 2016 presidential campaign and deals with a series of flubs and shifts in position on hot button issues. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) WASHINGTON (AP) – A dispute over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\\'s position on immigration erupted on Thursday, highlighting the Republican\\'s struggle to appeal to conservatives on explosive issue as he prepares to launch a presidential bid. The two-term governor has consistently opposed what he calls \"amnesty\" for immigrants in the country illegally, but his definition of amnesty has evolved. In a recent closed-door meeting with top New Hampshire Republicans, Walker said such immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country legally. That\\'s according to New Hampshire GOP chair Jennifer Horn, who organized the meeting and challenged a Thursday report in the Wall Street Journal that Walker said he supported giving such immigrants a pathway to citizenship. \"I specifically asked a follow-up question on the immigration reform issue, where he very clearly identified he was advocating a path for legal status but not citizenship,\" Horn said in an interview with the Associated Press. For the GOP, there is perhaps no more contentious issue heading into the 2016 presidential contest than illegal immigration. Republican voters remain deeply divided and the nation\\'s surging Hispanic population is expected to play a key role, particularly in swing states. More On This... Best pix of the week Immigration plan draws cheers, criticism across US The Major Players In The Immigration Debate The distinction between a pathway to citizenship and legal status matters little to many conservatives, who support widespread deportation to handle the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country illegally. Walker\\'s position is largely the same as that of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has been widely criticized by the GOP\\'s most passionate voters for supporting \"amnesty.\" Bush says he would start by verifying control of the U.S.-Mexican border, but also supports allowing people in the country illegally to seek legal status by first pleading guilty to illegal entry and serving a sentence of fines and community service. Horn said Walker\\'s comments came as he and his wife shared dessert in a Bedford, New Hampshire, restaurant with roughly 10 leading Republicans. In the half-hour discussion, Walker called for securing the border and allowing for more visas for high-skilled workers. He also said it was unreasonable to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally, preferring a system that allowed them to pay back taxes and achieve legal status over time, according to Horn. \"The governor was very specific that he was not advocating for citizenship for illegal immigrants,\" Horn said. However, in a 2013 interview with a Wisconsin newspaper editorial board, Walker said that offering such immigrants a pathway to citizenship \"makes sense.\" Earlier this month, he was asked during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" if he could \"envision a world where if these people paid a penalty, that they would have a path to citizenship.\" The governor responded: \"I believe there\\'s a way that you can do that. First and foremost, you\\'ve got to secure that border or none of these plans make any sense.\" On Thursday, Kirsten Kukowski, a spokesman for Walker\\'s political action committee, said that Walker \"has been very clear that he does not support amnesty and believes that border security must be established, and the rule of law must be followed.\" \"His position has not changed,\" Kukowski said. \"He does not support citizenship for illegal immigrants.\" Kukowski did not respond to a follow-up question about Walker\\'s position on granting immigrants legal status, which is considered amnesty by many conservative activists.

A new inspector generals report has concluded that Mayorkas, now the No. 2 official at the Homeland Security Department improperly intervened on behalf of foreign investors. It happened in three cases involving the U.S. government soliciting foreign investments in exchange for American visas. Investigators said Tuesday that his involvement created the appearance of favoritism and special access. The investigation could not suggest a motive for his involvement.  (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) WASHINGTON (AP) – House Republicans are expected to press a government watchdog for more answers about allegations of undue influence exerted by the Homeland Security Department\\'s No. 2 in three foreign investment visa cases. Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth concluded in a 99-page report released earlier this week that Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas improperly intervened in three investor visa cases involving prominent Democrats, including the youngest brother of likely Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. Roth said in his report that more than 15 whistleblowers spoke with his investigators about Mayorkas\\' intervention while he was head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The report concluded that in the three cases Mayorkas went \"outside of the normal ... process, and intervened with the career USCIS staff in ways that benefited\" the groups seeking his help. Mayorkas\\' actions, Roth wrote, created the appearance of favoritism and special access and caused resentment among career government employees, managers and lawyers. Roth is scheduled to testify about the investigation before the House Homeland Security Committee on Thursday. The investigation was first reported by the Associated Press days before Mayorkas\\' July 2013 Senate confirmation hearing. The visa applications Mayorkas is accused of meddling with were part of the U.S. government\\'s investor-visa program, known as EB-5, which allows foreigners to obtain visas to live permanently in the U.S. with their spouse and children if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for American citizens. Approved investors can become legal permanent residents after two years and later can become U.S. citizens. Mayorkas said in a statement Tuesday that he disagreed with the inspector general\\'s findings but that, \"I will certainly learn from it and from this process.\" The committee chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and several other GOP lawmakers have been openly critical of Mayorkas\\' appointment and his work at USCIS. Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee boycotted his confirmation hearing. The administration on Wednesday continued to defend Mayorkas, a longtime Democrat who served on President Barack Obama\\'s transition team after his 2008 election and was U.S. attorney in California under President Bill Clinton. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Roth\\'s report actually highlighted problems with the EB-5 investor visa program. \"Mr. Mayorkas is still at the Department of Homeland Security because he is a decorated public servant and an effective leader of that organization,\" Earnest said. \"And we certainly value the kind of contribution that he has made to the effective management of that department, and he has played an important role in implementing needed reforms in that department. In fact, he was somebody who was leading the effort to strengthen the EB-5 program.\" Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram More from Politics 31 mins ago The Super Bowl team Trump may not be rooting for on Sunday 1 hour ago Rubio scores key wins for Trump immigration agenda with blitz through Latin America 1 hour ago Trump’s cuts to foreign aid could benefit US position in Iran negotiations, expert says 1 hour ago Trudeau says Trump is serious about Canada becoming 51st state: reports Fox News Politics Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

Expand By The Associated Press | PUBLISHED: December 31, 2016 at 11:52 AM PST As 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts, violent attacks at gatherings and deaths of legendary celebrities. Here’s a look at how people are ushering in the new year: AUSTRALIA Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. The glittering display over Sydney’s harbor and bridge featured Saturn- and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie, among the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. Wilder was honored as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colors while a song from his film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. TURKEY New Year’s celebrations turned violent when an armed assailant opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul, wounding several people, a state-run news agency said. Private NTV television said more than one assailant may have been involved in the attack. The attacker or attackers are believed to have entered the nightclub disguised as Santa Claus, the station reported. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus or street vendors. Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people. Neslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighborhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” “2016 affected everyone badly,” she said. LAS VEGAS More than 300,000 visitors are expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year’s Eve celebration. Nightclubs are pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city’s celebrity chefs have crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts. A brief fireworks show will kick off at midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos. Federal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square. GERMANY In Berlin the mood was more somber than celebratory. “I don’t like the way politics is going,” Daniel Brandt said. “Fears are being fanned, and people are so angry with each other.” The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. Walking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” Nicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse.” Later, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. RUSSIA President Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. “Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret.” New Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. PARIS Tourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. “It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. “At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything.” Some people were happy to say goodbye to 2016. “It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, from Lyon. THE VATICAN Pope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” but has made no place for the young. Francis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” JAPAN Temple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. Kami Miyamoto, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, traveled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. “The world is heading toward conservative insular policies,” she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. “We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.” Miyamoto’s mother was preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. CHINA Residents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, were passing New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. The Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his New Year’s Eve address his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. SOUTH KOREA Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. The evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. The city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s World War II military. Park Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. INDIA For most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. The western city of Mumbai was to host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. PHILIPPINES The Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. Powerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. Duterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. Before New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days. ROMANIA New Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands of people flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. Former Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, traveling to the mountain town of Sinaia, said Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. “People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” Early Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats, a New Year symbol, while waving wands made of dried flowers. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES In Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. There was no repeat of the chaos of last year, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at a skyscraper nearby. NEW YORK CITY New Year’s Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before the glittering crystal ball was to drop. Officials estimated as many as a million celebrants would descend upon the Crossroads of the World, braving cold temperatures and strong winds to bring in the New Year amid heavy police protection. Stefania Moran, from Puebla, Mexico, and five friends traveled to New York to secure a coveted spot in one of 35 metal pens where re-entry is prohibited. “I’ve always wanted to come to New York, and this is one of the must-dos before you die,” she said. Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard. This year, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has the honor of pushing the Waterford crystal button that begins a 60-second countdown to 2017. Mariah Carey is the headline performer in Times Square for “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” on ABC. FINLAND CENTENARY Finland has kicked off celebrations for 100 years of independence from Russia. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Helsinki for a concert and a huge fireworks display to celebrate the beginning of festivities marking its independence. Throughout 2017 there will be hundreds of events in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million, from films, dance parties and environment-related events to concerts and activities linked to its renowned sauna tradition. Celebrations will culminate on Dec. 6, the day Finnish Parliament declared independence in 1917 amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday congratulated Finland for its centenary in a phone conversation with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. MEXICO CITY Thousands of people in Mexico City are expected to turn out for a New Year’s Eve concert at the Monument to Independence, better known as The Angel. Workers spent several days setting up a stage and a booming sound system along a stretch of the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard. Streets were blocked off in the area, and 2,000 police officers were on hand for security. The lineup includes a mix of Latin pop and balladeer Jorge “Coque” Muniz, with cumbia band Los Angeles Azules heating things up after a midnight fireworks show.

(AP) WASHINGTON (AP)  – When influential Democrats with stakes in different investment groups needed help securing visas as part of a complicated foreign investor program, they sought out a fellow Democrat who just happened to be in charge of the immigration agency overseeing their applications. Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services at the time, took up their causes, according to a report by the Homeland Security Department\\'s inspector general. Investigators say Mayorkas improperly intervened in three cases involving prominent Democrats, including a company run by the youngest brother of likely Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. In the report released Tuesday, investigators said Mayorkas helped efforts to secure the visas in ways that created the appearance of favoritism and special access. That, in turn, caused resentment among career government employees, managers and lawyers. The agency\\'s inspector general, John Roth, said he could not suggest a motive for Mayorkas, a longtime Democrat who served on President Barack Obama\\'s transition team after his 2008 election and was U.S. attorney in California under President Bill Clinton. Roth did not accuse Mayorkas of violating any laws and acknowledged that Mayorkas sometimes declined to become involved in cases because he said he did not think it would be appropriate. Mayorkas said in a statement that he disagreed with the inspector general\\'s findings but that \"I will certainly learn from it and from this process.\" More On This...

I could not and did not turn my back on my responsibility to address those grave problems. I made improving the program a priority and I did so in a hands-on manner.\" The U.S. government\\'s investor-visa program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to obtain visas to live permanently in the U.S. with their spouse and children if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for American citizens. Approved investors can become legal permanent residents after two years and later can become U.S. citizens. The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said the findings were \"extremely concerning\" and that he will conduct a congressional hearing about them Thursday. Roth was expected to testify. The Associated Press first reported in July 2013 — as Mayorkas was being considered for the No. 2 job at the Homeland Security Department — allegations that he had improperly intervened in the investor case involving a financing company run by Anthony Rodham, brother of Mrs. Clinton. Mayorkas told senators at his confirmation hearing that the allegations were \"unequivocally false\" and said he oversaw the program \"based on the law and the facts, and nothing else.\" The inspector general\\'s new conclusions also cast doubt on whether the Homeland Security Department withheld embarrassing internal files the AP had sought under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act as part of its own investigation nearly two years ago — and instead released records that indicated no wrongdoing. The AP in July 2013 requested all emails to or from Mayorkas over the preceding seven months that contained specific words or names, including Rodham. The government eventually sent AP more than 200 pages, mostly censored, including emails in which Mayorkas told investors and agency staff that he would not become involved in internal deliberations. \"I cannot weigh in,\" Mayorkas wrote to Assistant Secretary Douglas Smith on Feb. 1, 2013, in a message turned over to the AP and cited in the new inspector general\\'s report. \"The (investor\\'s) attorney sent an email to me and I responded that I could not weigh in.\" But the inspector general\\'s report also cited other messages from Mayorkas that were never turned over to AP. In one case, Mayorkas forwarded a January 2013 email from Rodham about delays with a high importance designation. The email would have been covered under AP\\'s information request since Mayorkas sent it during the relevant time period and contained Rodham\\'s name. \"Staff understood these applications were getting high-level attention,\" the inspector general\\'s report said. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was also connected to the investor proposal but later divested. His spokesman, Brian Coy, said the report demonstrated that McAuliffe asked the government to decide on the investment proposal in a timely fashion. The other two cases involved a Hollywood investment program and an investment effort in Nevada that had ties to former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, respectively. Mayorkas previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor. Another of Mrs. Clinton\\'s brothers, Hugh Rodham, had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that it was a mistake to talk to the White House about the request. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said there were lessons to be learned in the inspector general\\'s investigation but described Mayorkas in a statement as \"exceptionally conscientious, honest and patriotic.\" \"He is often impatient with our sluggish government bureaucracy, can at times be very hands-on in resolving issues and problems that are brought to his personal attention, and is always mindful that we are public servants,\" Johnson said. \"Ali works hard to do the right thing, and never acts, in my observation, for reasons of personal advancement or aggrandizement.\" Roth, the inspector general, praised as \"courageous\" the agency employees who confidentially had complained about Mayorkas\\' actions and promised they would be protected as whistleblowers.

As Congress begins a new battle over immigration policy, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) border patrol agents in Arizona are struggling to control undocumented immigrants that were pushed into the region by the 1990?s border crack-down in California called Operation Gatekeeper. A recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center using Census Bureau data estimates that the United States currently has an illegal immigrant population of 11.5 million to 12 million, about one-third of them arriving within the past 10 years. More than half are from Mexico. Ironically, beefed-up border patrols and increased security are reportedly having the unintended result of deterring many from returning to their country of origin.  (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) (2006 Getty Images) SAN DIEGO (AP) – A federal appeals court on Friday overturned decisions that put the burden of proof on foreigners who claim they were tortured in their home countries to show they cannot safely return to another part of the country they fled. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it is neither the responsibility of the petitioner nor the government to determine if it is safe for the person to return to another part of the country than where the torture occurred. An expanded panel of judges in San Francisco ruled for Roberto Curinsita Maldonado, who appealed a finding by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals that he didn\\'t qualify for a reprieve from deportation under the U.N. Convention Against Torture because he failed to prove he would be unsafe in any part of Mexico. A U.S. asylum officer had found that Maldonado\\'s allegations of being tortured by police in the central Mexican state of Michoacan were credible. The judges returned Maldonado\\'s case to the Board of Immigration Appeals, an administrative panel in the U.S. Justice Department, It was not immediately clear how much impact the ruling would have on others seeking to remain under the U.N. convention. Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department\\'s Executive Office for Immigration Review, said the agency had no comment on the decision. More On This...

Rick Santorum, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Donald Trump, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, bellow, as he interviews Howard \"Cowboy\" Woodward during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Md., Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) DENVER (AP) – Thanks to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, it\\'s becoming even clearer that immigration is the banana peel of 2016 Republican presidential politics. Just ask Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. He stepped up as a Senate leader on immigration only to slip and fall in a tea party ruckus over the issue. In a moment of candor, Rubio remembered the months of trying to get back up as \"a real trial for me.\" Others, too, have shifted on the matter. Now it\\'s oops for Walker. In 2013, Walker said it \"makes sense\" to offer a way to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. Early this month, however, he said he no longer supports \"amnesty.\" Complicating that switch, Walker recently discussed immigration with New Hampshire party leaders. One of them, state leader Jennifer Horn, says that Walker favored legal status, a position many conservatives equate with \"amnesty.\" Worse for Walker, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that he actually said he favored a path to citizenship, though Horn denies Walker said that. Even former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has a strong voice — and a book — on immigration, has wiggled. Rubio and Walker are not alone in embracing an immigration overhaul at some point. But doing so raises the specter of \"amnesty\" in the minds of those who want people unlawfully in the country to be given no relief from the threat of deportation. \"All the candidates have mixed statements — they have statements that seem to support amnesty and they all have ones that seem to oppose it,\" said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which seeks to reduce immigration. \"They\\'re torn between the big-money people who gain from high immigration and the voters who oppose it.\" Luis Alvarado, a California-based GOP strategist, said most Republican officials privately acknowledge that the country has to legalize the status of people who are here unlawfully while also bolstering border security. \"They believe that no one in their conscious mind can deport 11 million people from this country,\" Alvarado said. \"But, politically, they have to play word games to be elected in the primary.\" Among the potential 2016 hopefuls: —Bush has said he will not back away from his support for giving legal status to many in the country illegally. But his 2013 book outlining that stance marks a departure from an earlier position that envisaged eventual citizenship. —Before he shied away from the issue, Rubio co-wrote a bill with a path to citizenship that passed the Senate and failed in the House. He now says the bill was the wrong approach and that the focus should be on border security, a standard GOP position that leaves questions about deportation unanswered. —Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul voted against Rubio\\'s bill but says the millions of people in the country illegally cannot all be sent home. —New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie once supported an overhaul; now he won\\'t say where he stands. His state, though, is backing other Republican-led states in a suit against President Barack Obama\\'s orders deferring deportation for some immigrants. —Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is talking tougher on immigration than when he called his 2012 campaign rivals heartless if they opposed a law that lets some children of immigrants in the U.S. illegally pay in-state tuition at public colleges. Even so, he says the U.S. will not deport all people here illegally. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the only declared candidate so far, has kept a fairly consistent tough line on the issue. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said \"the ground has shifted\" on the issue for two reasons. He cited the influx of Central American youth crossing the border illegally last summer overwhelmed federal officials, and said Obama\\'s unilateral acts to shield some immigrants from deportation made it politically impossible for a Republican to embrace a pathway to citizenship. \"You\\'ve got to cut these guys some slack,\" Schlapp said of the presidential hopefuls and their wavering words. But Frank Sharry of America\\'s Voice, which supports an overhaul, said some of Bush\\'s rivals are \"going to be accused of flip-flopping and that\\'s going to become a character issue\" playing into Bush\\'s hands. The wide-open nature of the GOP race also brings to light a tension between what some Republican fundraisers want — an overhaul with a legal path — and what conservative primary voters wish for. Spencer Zwick, finance chairman for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, is one donor who has said he will only support candidates who favor such an overhaul. At this early stage, the competition for dollars has been more intense than the competition for votes. \"Once they get into the debates, this all changes,\" Beck of Numbers USA predicted, meaning he expects the candidates to rally behind a harder line.

Now, as her National Front party’s treasurer says it’s looking “everywhere” for the 20 million euros ($21 million) needed to fund upcoming campaigns, she may be looking to Russia for cash – again. While foreign donations to French political parties are barred, loans are not. But it’s still a daring prospect for a party whose finances have already drawn unwanted scrutiny. Alleged funding irregularities have prompted multiple legal investigations and an impending trial for several party officials and associates, and a 2014 loan from a Russian bank raised concerns over Moscow’s potential influence on French democracy. Not to mention the U.S. decision this week to impose sanctions and expel Russians over alleged cyber-meddling in the U.S. presidential election. The French National Front says it’s the target of a smear campaign, and notes that other candidates have also had financial troubles. Le Pen’s firm rejection of foreign influence would make fishing for finances outside French waters a no-go, were it not for her Russia-friendly stance and what party officials say is the refusal of French banks to lend money to the anti-immigration National Front. Funds are needed to finance campaigning for the April-May presidential vote and June parliamentary elections. Party officials deny recent reports that they have already received a new loan from a Russian establishment – but no one is denying that the party may be asking for one. “We are looking everywhere. We are working discreetly,” party treasurer Wallerand de Saint Just told The Associated Press. The National Front needs 20 million euros for its electoral campaigns, and already has a portion of it, he said in a telephone interview, without specifying the amount in hand. They’re not ruling out funding requests from sources including Russia, the United Arab Emirates, or even the United States, he said. The party borrowed 9 million euros in 2014 from the small First Czech Russian Bank, but the bank’s license was revoked this year, Saint Just said. Other Russian banks might consider a new loan. Moscow has courted far-right parties in Europe in an influence-building campaign as friction between Russia and the West has mounted over Ukraine and the Syrian civil war. Some leaders like Le Pen have hobnobbed in Moscow and at embassy events at home. Chieftains of Hungary’s anti-Semitic Jobbik and Austria’s Freedom Party also have made the trip. Le Pen envisions a concept of Europe that stretches “from the Atlantic to the Urals,” that would encompass Russia instead of pressuring it over Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian policies. In a shifting of views in Russia’s favor, some mainstream politicians, from France’s conservative Francois Fillon, a top presidential contender, to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, are sympathetic to a friendly approach to Moscow. Finding ways to raise money has run like a leitmotif through Le Pen’s quest to make the National Front an alternative to mainstream political parties – and has led to run-ins with the law. The party treasurer, Saint Just, is among seven people called to stand trial for alleged schemes to bolster party coffers. Le Pen is not implicated, but the party has also been called in for judgment, along with two concerns run by old Le Pen friends. They allegedly helped raise funds through a complex system that judicial authorities deem illegal. “I will be acquitted,” Saint Just said. “We have absolutely done nothing wrong.” A trial date has not been set, but a judicial official said it was unlikely to take place before the elections, so as not to “interfere with democracy.” There is concern now that any new effort to tap Russian banks for loans could do just that, however, by making France vulnerable to influence from the Kremlin. “There is an ambient Russia-phobia that is now leading to theories of plots,” the National Front’s No. 2 official, Florian Philippot, said Thursday on the iTele TV station. U.S. intelligence agencies suspect that Moscow hacked into private email accounts to interfere with the U.S. political process in favor of Trump – a claim shrugged off by Putin, who said recently that the hackers could have been located anywhere. A Russia-friendly approach to geopolitics runs in the Le Pen family. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front’s co-founder, his daughter Marine and her niece Marion Marechal-Le Pen have all made numerous visits to Moscow over the years. Russian guests were present at the party’s congress in 2014. Marine Le Pen even remarked in a May interview with RT France, a Kremlin-backed television network, that France could recognize Crimea as Russian “if I were elected president.” Relations between Russia and the West degenerated after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea amid fighting between Moscow-backed separatists and Ukraine government troops. French satirical and investigative weekly Le Canard Enchaine last week published excerpts of what it said was a letter by U.S. Republican Rep. Mike Turner, on the Select Committee of Intelligence, worried about ties between Putin and Le Pen. He reportedly asked James Clapper, director of national intelligence, for supplementary information on a vast disinformation war against the U.S. and other countries whose interests are opposed to Russia’s. The letter as reported by Le Canard Enchaine cited Le Pen’s remark on Crimea and claimed her party had asked Russia in February for a $30 million loan. France’s governing socialist immediately demanded clarification, calling the reported amount “astronomical.” Treasurer Saint Just called the reported request “mysterious.” February would have been too early to seek a loan, he said, adding “and I always said we want 20 million euros maximum. We don’t want more.” Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error Most Popular Most Popular 3 in disabled pickup killed in 91 Freeway crash in Buena Park 3 in disabled pickup killed in 91 Freeway crash in Buena Park More than 100 Billabong, Quiksilver, Volcom retail shops closing in US, several in Orange County More than 100 Billabong, Quiksilver, Volcom retail shops closing in US, several in Orange County Dodger Stadium’s $100M renovation focused on player facilities Dodger Stadium’s $100M renovation focused on player facilities Disneyland drops strict Star Wars timeline in Galaxy’s Edge Disneyland drops strict Star Wars timeline in Galaxy’s Edge Walt Disney lecture series coming to Chapman University — and it’s free Walt Disney lecture series coming to Chapman University — and it’s free 2 arrested in connection with man found dead in Anaheim motel room 2 arrested in connection with man found dead in Anaheim motel room Tammy Kim drops out of Irvine City Council race amid lawsuit about her residency Tammy Kim drops out of Irvine City Council race amid lawsuit about her residency Trump administration sues Chicago in latest crackdown on ‘sanctuary’ cities Trump administration sues Chicago in latest crackdown on ‘sanctuary’ cities Postal supervisor in Costa Mesa admits stealing more than $300,000 in checks and gold, currency Postal supervisor in Costa Mesa admits stealing more than $300,000 in checks and gold, currency Buena Park High staff member placed on leave following racially-charged social media posts Buena Park High staff member placed on leave following racially-charged social media posts Trending Nationally Trump, Musk move to oust EPA staff in the Great Lakes region, including dozens responsible for protecting drinking water for 30 million in U.S. and Canada More than 100 Billabong, Quiksilver, Volcom retail shops closing in US 6,000-pound massive shark washes up on Cape Cod in the winter: Possibly ‘made a wrong turn’ and got trapped Elon Musk almost needed SFPD wellness check after ‘breakdown,’ getting booed at Dave Chappelle show Kanye West says he’s ‘Yaydolf Yitler,’ praises Hitler in new antisemitic rant'},\n",

While politicians and advocacy organizations work at coming up with legislation to reform the U.S. immigration system, the Jesuits are tackling some of its problems head on at the border, in higher education institutions and in parishes. (CNS photo/Jose Luis Gonzalez, Reuters) WASHINGTON (CNS) — While politicians and advocacy organizations work at coming up with legislation to reform the U.S.\\xa0immigration\\xa0system, the Jesuits are tackling some of its problems head-on at the Mexican border, in higher education institutions and in parishes. Soon, they’ll start analyzing what changes might help people to stay in their homelands. Two reports released by Jesuit institutions in recent weeks lay out problems and propose ways of addressing two complex situations: how undocumented immigrants are treated as they migrate and what undocumented students encounter in Jesuit colleges and universities. Jesuit Father Richard Ryscavage, director of Fairfield University’s Center for Faith and Public Life and a professor of sociology and anthropology, oversaw the colleges study. He told Catholic News Service that both efforts are part of the Jesuits’ worldwide focus on migration of the past five to six years. He said other components in the United States include a project in Long Island to develop a model for debating\\xa0immigration\\xa0at the parish level — framing it from the perspective of faith. “How to make it a little less of a screaming match,” is how Father Ryscavage put it. Another effort is a collaboration just beginning with the Red Cross to figure out at what level institutional or economic breakdowns lead people to decide to leave their homes, and then work at fixing it, Father Ryscavage said. But upfront, the two reports look at the everyday situations faced at Jesuit universities when students lack legal\\xa0immigration\\xa0status and those of migrants who visit a Jesuit-run dining room at the Arizona-Mexico border. “Documented Failures: The Consequences of\\xa0Immigration\\xa0Policy on the U.S.-Mexico Border,” looked at data collected from March through October 2012 from nearly 5,000 people who passed through a dining hall in Nogales, Mexico. Located a few blocks from the U.S. border, the dining room run by the Jesuits’ Kino Border Initiative serves people who were recently deported or are planning to try to get into the United States illegally. The Mexican and Central American migrants were questioned about how they were treated by the U.S. Border Patrol and by police agencies in other countries and about the circumstances at home that led them to leave. The report was released Feb. 13 by the Jesuit Conference USA, Jesuit Refugee Service and the Kino Border Initiative, which has an educational component as well as operating the dining hall and a shelter for deported women and children. Patterns that emerged included: More than a third of the women and 23 percent of the men said they were separated from immediate family members in the deportation process. In many of those cases, the deported person left behind U.S. citizen children or spouses in their U.S. homes. In others, migrants picked up while entering the United States were deported to different cities in Mexico than the relatives with whom they traveled. One in four migrants reported being mistreated in some way by the U.S. Border Patrol, including by being denied their right to contact their home country’s consulate, verbal abuse and theft. Nearly 8 percent reported being mistreated by police in Mexico, most commonly through theft. About 10 percent of Central Americans and 4 percent of Mexicans reported being victims of crime along their migration trek, including theft and sexual assault. A query from CNS to U.S. Customs and Border Protection seeking response to the study was not answered by March 8. Jesuit Father Sean Carroll, director of the Kino Border Initiative, said the survey data affirmed anecdotal experiences he and other staff and volunteers have heard in the four years since the dining room opened. He told CNS he was especially struck by “the degree to which violence is a motive for people’s migration north.” Gang violence, political violence and crime in general have risen in Guatemala and Honduras recently, and the level in El Salvador, while reduced since peaks in the 1990s, remains high. More than 10 percent of the migrants from each of those countries cited violence at home as the reason they left. The report did not take issue with\\xa0immigration\\xa0law and overall policy so much as discuss migrants’ experiences with those policies. It recommended steps to improve how U.S. and Mexican authorities treat migrants. Its 22 recommendations included, for instance, that the Department of Homeland Security implement a standard procedure to ensure families are not needlessly separated by deportation; that agency staff be better trained on parental and humanitarian rights and due process protections; that deported migrants be removed in a safer manner, i.e.: not dropped off at night in dangerous sections of Mexican cities; and that Mexican and U.S. authorities take steps to protect people from crime and follow up with investigations and prosecution when crimes occur. The Immigrant Students National Position Paper, released in January, was co-written by legal and social research teams from Fairfield University in Connecticut, Loyola University Chicago and Santa Clara University in California. The three institutions used a Ford Foundation grant to survey administrators and students at six schools in depth and conduct a smaller online survey at all 28 U.S. Jesuit colleges and universities about the institutional practices that affect students who\\xa0lack legal\\xa0immigration\\xa0status. Father Ryscavage said the staff of the universities have been aware of the burgeoning issue of undocumented students since the 1990s. But as they surfaced, individual departments handled their needs in an ad hoc manner, providing financial aid or assistance through student life programs. The study observed that the issue of how Jesuit schools treat undocumented students “becomes a matter of social justice and institutional identity.” It looks at undocumented students’ experiences and problems, such as their inability to work legally, to travel abroad or to take research assistantships if federal grant money is involved. The report proposed a variety of steps for the institutions, at the level of school mission, admissions and financial aid offices, on-campus services and career counseling. The report notes that 65,000 undocumented students a year graduate from U.S. high schools, then they “face young adulthood without the benefit of U.S. citizenship and face tremendous legal barriers in seeking lawful\\xa0immigration\\xa0status.” About 5 to 10 percent of those graduates seek to go on to college. Some states bar undocumented students from entering public universities, others require them to pay higher out-of-state tuition no matter what their residency. Private schools generally only must ensure that undocumented students do not receive financial aid that comes from government sources. A stopgap measure enacted by the Obama administration last year provides a path for some of these young people to apply for a temporary deferral of deportation. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, “changed everything,” Father Ryscavage said. “It gave some of them the confidence to speak up and be more articulate about their status,” he said. Those students’ friends, who didn’t realize they knew anyone who was undocumented, “did their homework,” began to learn about the problem and have joined in efforts to change federal laws and local policies that affect them, he said. — By Patricia Zapor Catholic News Service Share this: Tweet Email Previous article Religious leaders meet with Obama on immigration reform Next article ‘Between life and death’: Central Americans still heading north Catholic News Service Catholic News Service, serving since 1920 as a news agency specializing in reporting religion, is the primary source of national and world news that appears in the U.S. Catholic press.

       "  'text': 'Merkel Decries “Distorted Picture” Of Refugee Policy, Claims “Our State Is Stronger Together” December 31, 2016 by Infinite – Merkel Decries “Distorted Picture” Of Refugee Policy, Claims “Our State Is Stronger Together”: In an awkwardly similar rhetoric to the failed slogan of Hillary Clinton, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her nation that “together, we are stronger. Our state is stronger,” giving no ground on her increasingly questioned open-border refugee policy as she slammed the “distorted picture” being painted by populists . Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to stay calm in the face of Islamist terrorism and, as Bloomberg reports, criticized nationalists for offering false hopes of security, signaling she’ll count on voters to opt for stability when she runs for a fourth term in 2017. In her New Year’s Eve speech to the nation, Merkel predicted a contentious political climate in a year that’ll include Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. president on Jan. 20 and elections in France and the Netherlands. “As we pursue our lives and our work, we tell the terrorists: They are murderers full of hatred, but it’s not they who determine how we live and want to live,” Merkel said, according to an advance copy of the nationally televised speech on Saturday. “We are free, humane, open. Together, we are stronger. Our state is stronger.” Merkel’s comments reflect the surge in political risks to her chancellorship, though she may benefit because she’s familiar to voters and has no obvious successor after 11 years in office. Merkel gave no ground on her open-border refugee policy and took aim at populists who question the value of the European Union “or even of parliamentary democracy itself.” “What a distorted picture,” she said. While the EU should focus on tasks it can truly do better than national governments, “we Germans should never let ourselves be tricked into believing that going it alone as a nation could lead to a happy future,” Merkel said. Merkel sought to push back against her critics, saying she’ll work for a political debate “where we argue passionately about many things, but always as democrats,” with criticism voiced “peacefully and with respect for the individual.” Merkel has become the target of online vilification and an unprecedented political challenge by the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, since leaving Germany’s borders open as more than 1 million refugees arrived over the past two years.

Chris Christie delivers his budget address, Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2015, in Trenton, N.J. Christie, who is considering a run for president in 2016, announced that the New Jersey Education Association â the state\\'s largest teachers union and long one of his main political foils â has signed onto a \"road map\" for further reforms. He\\'ll call on state lawmakers to join with him. (AP Photo/Mel Evans) NEWARK, N.J. (AP)  – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has repeatedly refused to outline his positions on the nation\\'s immigration system, quietly signed onto an amicus brief opposing President Obama\\'s executive action on immigration. The brief filed Monday by New Jersey, Texas, Louisiana and South Dakota urges an appeals court to uphold a preliminary injunction blocking action that could spare millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally from deportation. The states involved say moving forward with the programs would cause them \"irreparable injuries.\" \"The question presented is whether the President can unilaterally legalize the presence of millions of people and unilaterally give them myriad legal benefits, including work permits, Medicare, Social Security and tax credits,\" they wrote. \"Washington\\'s attempt to turn this into a policy debate only underscores the dearth of legal arguments to support Defendants\\' unilateral efforts to hand out government benefits in violation of federal law,\" the brief read. More On This... Best pix of the week Christie, who is weighing a run for president, has been generally critical of President Barack Obama\\'s immigration policies, but has refused to answer questions about how he would approach the issue. His office did not publicize the brief. A spokesman confirmed New Jersey had signed on, but declined to comment Wednesday. Twenty-six states, led by Texas, joined to challenge Obama\\'s November 2014 actions as unconstitutional, arguing the policies would force them to invest more in law enforcement, health care and education. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who has pushed for comprehensive immigration reform, defended the legality of Obama\\'s actions and pointed to the residents who would benefit from them. \"Let\\'s not forget that an estimated 204,000 people in New Jersey will be able to come out of the shadows and contribute to the community and the economy thanks to the President\\'s executive actions,\" he said in a statement. \"These are moms and dads — good people, hard-working people — who will register with the government, pass a background check, get a work permit, pay taxes and no longer fear deportation.\" The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice also criticized the state\\'s move, saying, \"Governor Christie\\'s support of this misguided lawsuit is further proof his political aspirations trump the needs and will of the people of New Jersey.\" Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram More from Politics 4 mins ago The Super Bowl team Trump may not be rooting for on Sunday 38 mins ago Rubio scores key wins for Trump immigration agenda with blitz through Latin America 1 hour ago Trump’s cuts to foreign aid could benefit US position in Iran negotiations, expert says 1 hour ago Trudeau says Trump is serious about Canada becoming 51st state: reports Fox News Politics Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

I believe that this is the opening salvo for which the Russians will receive the blame. the grid is next.” Saturday, December 31, 2016 By Paul Martin By Dave Hodges TheCommonSenseShow.com December 31st, 2016 I am not a fan of Putin, but with regard to his recent conduct in the face of countless Obama provocations, Putin’s patience is the only reason that we are not already at war with Russia. I have almost lost count at the time number of times that President Obama, has poked “the bear” with the proverbial stick. It is true, that Putin has assassinated his rivals and does the same with dissident media. He has created false flag events to justify invasion of its neighbors in an effort to reassert centralized Russian authority over its former Republics from the old days of the Soviet Union. However, this was then and the world today is a far different place. Unlike Our Leaders, the Russian Leaders Put Their People First Russia is no longer a country that maligns and persecutes Christianity. Where Christians used to worship in secret, Russia plays home to a rising Christian religion. Russia has a 13% flat tax rate. American small business owners typically pay 45% in tax between federal and state tax rates. Unlike in America, the Russian wealthy pay taxes. Their citizens can order medicine from abroad to save money, unlike the people in the United States. Russian children attend college for a nominal price. There are no predatory student loans in Russia. Russia, through their BRICS affiliation, is transforming their economy into a gold-backed economy, although they do have a long way to go. Putin puts his people first, as evidenced by the fact that Russia recently conducted a civil defense drill in which 40 million Russians were taken underground in order to survive a nuclear attack, leaving us to ask Obama, where are our bunkers? Russia restricts immigration to people who can make a real contribution to theircountry. Sharia law is not tolerated in any form and Russia refuses to be a repository for UN forced immigration designed to destroy the culture of the host country as we are seeing in Europe and beginning to see here in America. I just reread what I wrote here and I feel like Rip Van Winkle who just woke up and I discovered that I am living in a foreign country. I have no desire to call Russia my country, I do not identify with Putin. for example, when I ever so briefly watch the Olympics and Russia and the USA are competing, I root for the USA everytime. However, it is time to admit the truth, Russia is moving in the direction of freedom for its citizens and America has already become an abject police state. I mourn for my lost country. There are those of you who old enough to remember that for decades Russia was the symbol of political oppression. Russia represented everything that we hoped to avoid. Communism has a new home and it is called the DNC that has hijacked our government on behalf of the New World Order.

       "  'text': 'POLITICS Deported Iowa pastor speaks publicly for the first time since arriving in Honduras By Fox News Published March 25, 2015 2:15pm EDT | Updated January 4, 2017 2:22am EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email (YouTube) The Iowa pastor whose detention and ultimate deportation sparked rallies in support of him spoke to the media for the first time since he was sent back to his native Honduras last week. Speaking to the Spanish-language news channel Univision , Max Villatoro said that he was going to fight to be allowed to return to the United States and also criticized the treatment he and other immigrants received while in custody. \"I don\\'t think I should be treated as a criminal,\" Villatoro said. \"It\\'s as if it doesn\\'t matter that I overcame my record so I could stay. Overnight they can just arrest you, send you from jail to jail and treat you like an animal.\" Villatoro, who was convicted in 1999 of drunken driving and tampering with records, was arrested on March 3 as part of a nationwide roundup of more than 2,000 undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of crimes. During his interview with Univision, the pastor spoke about the deplorable conditions in which he was held before his deportation. \"The last jail I was in [before being deported] had 200 people, and four sinks and four toilets. For 200 people,\" Villatoro said. Villatoro\\'s attorney, David Leopold, said his client\\'s deportation contradicted the supposed new priorities among immigration agents that call for focusing on arresting and deporting those who pose the greatest danger to public safety and national security. Another attorney for Villatoro said that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted Villatoro a work permit about a decade ago that remained valid until his arrest. \"These convictions were in the late 1990s,\" Leopold told Fox News Latino last week . \"This is a good man, the worst thing you could say about him is he had a DUI in his life.\" Immigration officials have said they are \"focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of convicted criminals and public safety threats. The agency exercises prosecutor discretion, on a case-by-case basis, as necessary to focus resources on these priorities.\" Since his drunk driving arrest, Villatoro married his wife, Gloria, had four children, and became a pastor at Torre Fuerte, a Spanish-speaking Mennonite congregation in Iowa City. The 41-year old holy man left Honduras in 1995, but says that he has no support network in the Central American. Villatoro added that he would not seek to bring his family to Honduras and, if he was unable to return to the U.S., he would seek another country to live in.

Dems Plan To Use MILLIONS In Taxpayer Money To Keep Illegal Immigrants From Being Deported dailycaller.com ^ | 12/31/16\\n | Justin Caruso Posted on 12/31/2016 3:12:32 PM PST by ColdOne Democratic politicians, including mayors in three major cities, are looking to use millions in taxpayer funds to protect illegal immigrants in their cities from deportation. Mayors of Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco are looking to create funds to provide attorneys to illegal immigrants who face deportation, the Wall Street Journal reports. If these efforts succeed, the amount of taxpayer money set aside to protect illegal immigrants will easily be in the millions. California alone will consider a bill that may cost between $10-80 million per year. Los Angeles has already set aside $10 million for an immigrant defense fund.

       "  'text': 'Happy new year, everyone. ****** Mark Armstrong, leader of the Intercontinental Church of God, has released another weekly update (December 30, 2016). Once again he fixates on Muslims simplistically stereotyped as violent extremists and appeals to xenophobia. Churches which condemn deportations are slurred as profiting from them. Accepting \"illegal aliens and refugees\" is condemned as being \"against the will of the people\". Note how he does not even bother to question if these refugees are true refugees. It seems he does not want his nation to even allow actual refugees to find a safe haven in America. As is common in Islamophobia the acts of violent extremists are used to discredit liberals. Doubtful many will mourn the passing of calendar year 2016. \\xa0It\\'s been a time of accelerating the influx of illegal aliens and refugees at citizens\\' expense against the will of the people , with the possible exception of the churches profiting from their involvement. \\xa0It was a year liberally punctuated with some of the most heinous terror attacks throughout western civilization, including here in the United States. \\xa0We\\'ve learned, as Israel already knew, that the enemy within doesn\\'t have to hijack airplanes or build bombs to carry out a massacre. \\xa0Would-be terrorists only need to jump behind the wheel of a vehicle, or start wielding a knife in a crowd. \\xa0As these realities have dawned on more and more casual observers, our outgoing civilian leaders remain aloof, in complete and utter denial. He condemns the United States\\' abstaining from voting about a resolution condemning the construction of Israeli settlements on land acquired after the Six Day War of 1967. He responds to concerns about the influence of suspected Russian hackers on the presidential election by accusing the Obama Administration of trying to make Netanyahu lose in the Israeli elections of 2015. Suddenly, after years of empty threats (the Syrian “red line,” and “we can do stuff too,” as told to Putin), the president has deported a stable of Russian diplomats back to where they came from for having purportedly released damaging internal communications derived from the Democratic National Committee. \\xa0None were made up or fraudulent, but they did show illegal and underhanded collusion to usher Hillary Clinton into position to win the presidency. \\xa0Roars of outrage can still be heard as “experts and analysts” claim that “foreign influence and interference” was a factor in her loss. Nobody on those discussion panels, particularly the animated and angry, seem to have any recollection of well-documented White House influence and U. S. moneys requisitioned to defeat Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli election of last year. \\xa0But, much to the president\\'s chagrin, Netanyahu won anyway. Iran is denounced as usual. Russia\\'s increased military presence in Syria is mentioned as evidence of America\\'s decline. While alluding to the widespread celebrations ushering the new year he cites \"the ravings of the angry left [and] the malevolent intentions of demented jihadists\" as common threats to his audience. His Islamophobia is a tool to vilify the left. The first of January will be celebrated by vast throngs of revelers all across the globe as one time zone after another clicks over to calendar year 2017. \\xa0With any luck, it will herald not only the end of a calendar year, but the beginning of the end of an era of politically correct lunacy. \\xa0But neither the ravings of the angry left nor the malevolent intentions of demented jihadists will recede quietly. Tensions regarding the South China Sea is mentioned. He then condemns leaders in Europe for accepting immigrants. Recently acts of mass murder are used to scare monger against accepting immigrants and refugees in general. The arrival of immigrants, many of whom are fleeing from a cataclysmic war in Syria, is hysterically denounced as causing \"the loss of security and the steady demolition of their inherited culture\" and as the product of a \"destructive ideology\". He wildly accuses these immigrants, many of whom fled the war in Syria, of trampling over \"every pretext of law, order and civility\". \\xa0Unlike the unfortunate people of Syria this individual in Tyler has never had to see his nation get torn apart as has happened in Syria. The leaders of Europe are appalled by what they\\'ve seen take place in Britain (leaving the EU) and in the election of Donald Trump. \\xa0The terrorist attacks in Brussels, Paris, Nice and Berlin? \\xa0They\\'ve taken those in self-righteous stride, knowing they\\'re “doing the right thing” where immigration is concerned. \\xa0As the people of Europe experience first-hand the loss of security and the steady demolition of their inherited culture, the hated “populist” movement may well sweep away the power of haughty Euro-crats as early as next year. \\xa0We\\'ll see. \\xa0But Europe is in economic and cultural decline the likes of which its inhabitants have not known since the fall of Hitler. \\xa0They\\'re watching as Britain and the United States opt out of the destructive ideology preached by pope Francis and Angela Merkel, while every pretext of law, order and civility is trampled by a variety of immigrants and refugees who don\\'t even much like each other. It seems strange that he should say, \"Europe is in economic and cultural decline the likes of which its inhabitants have not known since the fall of Hitler.\" Hitler\\'s fall was a good thing. His turn of phrase sounds odd. That should have been worded differently. He ends this weekly update by insisting that the time is short before the tapestry of dire prophecies taught by HWA, Garner Ted Armstrong and their various imitators will soon occur. He also promotes the discredited idea of British Israelism . White Americans are inaccurately referred to as \"the descendants of Biblical Israel\". Have you ever seen so many things in such a state of flux, all at the same time? \\xa0The weeks and months ahead promise to be one of the most interesting, potentially dangerous times in human history. \\xa0We intend to continue putting out the information that will help people understand who the descendants of Biblical Israel actually are, and what kind of responsibility that entails. \\xa0The sermon preached here in Tyler last week by Mr. Stan Roberts goes extensively through that very subject, and we highly recommend it. \\xa0It is entitled, Wake up ISRAEL! There are indications that the Word is getting out. Although it is taught that Europe is fated to conquer the United States one cannot help but notice how he chooses to scare monger about Muslims while he teaches that Europe is fated to conquer the United States. What a glaring inconsistency. So even while so many are celebrating in this happy time of holidays and celebration he still insists on trying to keep his audience feel miserable and scared.'},\n",

I bet this guy was trying to get caught. Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing https://t.co/EuxnrYpis2 — Neil Combee (@NeilCombee) August 6, 2016 Swedish cop in bikini tackles ‘lucky’ homeless crook https://t.co/NjNdhEmNnQ — TomoNews US (@TomoNewsUS) August 3, 2016 Spread of the news instantly gained the fit cop nearly 30,000 instagram followers. Now, after 11 years on the force, the famed officer has decided to turn in her badge in protest to her department’s recent reorganization that, according to Kellner, has resulted in personnel being treated unfairly.\\xa0 Per Sputnik : “The main reason is that I’ve not felt comfortable with the recent [police] reorganization. I do not think that personnel are being treated fairly, as they should.” “[Being a police officer] has become a bit like a second identity, and I feel bad about not doing a good job.” Though Kellner didn’t mention it, Sweden’s police force has recently been plagued by understaffing and a rapid rise in violent crime that seemingly corresponded with the arrival of thousands of migrants from the Middle East and Northern Africa. The level of violence within certain areas rose to such a level that police abandoned efforts to control the streets, leading to the establishment of 55 “no-go zones” (something we discussed in further detail here:\\xa0 “ Sweden Creates 55 “No-Go Zones” As It Loses Control Of Refugee Crisis “). All in all, Sweden’s police force has been plagued by severe understaffing, underpayment and low crime detection — despite the allocation of billions of extra kronor in backup. A report published earlier this year suggested as many as 80 percent of Swedish police officers were considering pursuing a different careers due to the danger they face in the field. In recent months, Sweden was plagued by ballooning criminality in the form of sex attacks, burglary, murder, vehicular arson and violence toward the police in blighted suburban areas. Much of the crime, however, is linked to specific suburbs in urban communities populated by migrants, where police rarely venture outside police stations for fear of being attacked by locals — a fact that the Swedish authorities are loath to admit. In light of the Swedish practice to conceal the identity of the perpetrators, many suggest that the authorities and police conspire to cover up migrant crime to whitewash the country’s immigration policy. While we hate to see someone with her particular “talents” get pushed out of the force, we wish Ms. Kellner the best of luck with her personal training career. * * * PayPal: Donate in USD PayPal: Donate in EUR PayPal: Donate in GBP Categories Global News , Politics , Society Tags Global News , Government , Migrant Crisis , Politics , Sweden And Now The Weather … Sick Care vs. Health Care ….

       "  'text': 'Fin de Año Recorrido por los cócteles navideños de las comunidades del sur de Florida ¿De cuántas de estas bebidas has oído hablar? ¿Cuántas has probado? ¿Qué tan del sur de Florida eres? Por Briana Trujillo • Publicado el 31 de diciembre del 2024 • Actualizado a las 1:22 pm del 31 de diciembre del 2024 Telemundo Gabriel Urrutia sonríe radiante cuando habla de todo lo que tiene que ver con el sur de Florida. El nativo de Miami, autor de Miami Sips & Eats y profesor adjunto de la Escuela de Hotelería Chaplin de la Universidad Internacional de Florida no puede contener su emoción y sonríe cuando describe la ubicuidad de una de las bebidas navideñas de nuestra área. “Estuve en Joe Stone Crab y, de hecho, lanzaron el primer coquito, creo, en sus 113 años de historia”, dice Urrutia. “Así que esto demuestra cómo el coquito ha capturado los corazones y las mentes de los habitantes del sur de Florida en todo el mundo”. Noticias de Florida 24/7 en Telemundo 51. MIRA AQUÍ El título de la bebida de invierno más reconocible, más disponible y más aceptada tiene que ser el coquito de Puerto Rico, su propio nombre destaca el ingrediente que Urrutia cree que habla especialmente del sur de Florida. Describe a Miami y al coco como “los mejores amigos de una clase”. No es de extrañar que hayamos hecho del coquito “nuestro plato”. Pero más allá de la lista de ingredientes, es la forma en que bebemos el coquito -y muchas otras bebidas navideñas de la diáspora- lo que cuenta la historia única de inmigración de nuestra región. Manténte al tanto de las noticias locales y del estado del tiempo. Suscríbete a nuestros newsletters gratuitos aquí. SUSCRÍBETE Desde las recetas hasta la forma de servir estas bebidas, la experiencia del coquito, el sorrel jamaiquino, las cremas haitianas, el ponche crema venezolano con una práctica común en comunidad, que forma, establece y reafirma vínculos entre culturas que le dan al sur de Florida su identidad única. Entonces, para alardear de: ¿Cuántas de estas bebidas has oído hablar? ¿Cuántas has probado? Y, por último, piensa: ¿Qué tan del sur de Florida eres? Sorrel ¿Qué lo hace especial? Su color y textura. Es la única bebida de esta lista que no recuerda al ponche de huevo. Local Hace 15 horas Las 5 del 51-Las Noticias más importantes Cuba Hace 16 horas José Daniel Ferrer desafía al régimen cubano mientras crecen las amenazas de su regreso a prisión Comenzaremos con la bebida que se destaca, la colorida mezcla que proviene de Jamaica y cuyo ingrediente principal le da su nombre y tono: el sorrel. Esta bebida navideña, hecha con la parte exterior de la flor de hibisco -que generalmente se cosechaba en invierno, según seriouseats.com-, es agridulce, con sabor a jengibre y un poco de canela. \"Es genial\", dice Urrutia. \"Puedes disfrutarla como si fuera un refresco. Puedes disfrutarla en un té. Pero durante las fiestas, nuevamente, esa hermosa manera de agregarle un poco de alcohol al sorrel real, y obtienes este hermoso licor, casi floral y afrutado\". El ron es el licor base de esta bebida rosada y rojiza. Cremas ¿Qué lo hace especial? El jugo de lima, y \\u200b\\u200bque puedes tomarlo cuando te apetezca. La bebida cremosa y con sabor a ron que se disfruta en las fiestas en Haití ha llegado a la gente del sur de Florida, y Kasa Champet en Pembroke Pines es uno de los lugares que la sirven. Jody Julmice, que es copropietaria del restaurante con su madre, dice que han estado vendiendo este clásico de las fiestas por botella y por copa. “Cuando estás con la familia y abres esa botella de cremas, todos saben automáticamente que va a ser buena. Sabes, nunca antes había probado una crema mala, porque está hecha con tanto amor e intención”, asegura Julmice, quien explica que las recetas de cremas, como las del coquito, se transmiten de generación en generación. “Muchos haitianos lo hacen de diferentes maneras”, apunta Julmice. “No hay cremas realmente perfectas, porque cada uno le añade su toque personal, pero en general, sigue siendo el mismo sabor, y es algo que cualquier haitiano puede reconocer una vez que lo prueba”. ¿Qué es ese sabor que se reconoce al instante? “Vas a sentir el sabor del ron al momento”, asevera Julmice. “Tan pronto como toque tus labios, sentirás el sabor del ron. Es realmente muy bueno. Algunos de los ingredientes principales serían leche evaporada, leche condensada, crema de coco, un poco de nuez moscada, canela, extracto de vainilla, extracto de almendras, jugo de lima. Y luego ese ron Barbancourt o ese Clairin”. Pero la forma en que se comparte la crema, pasando de mano en mano para que los invitados la disfruten en un ambiente íntimo, es lo que, según Julmice, la hace “realmente especial”. \"La cuestión es que se puede beber crema durante todo el día. Podemos tomarla en nuestro café. Podemos tomarla durante la cena, podemos tomarla como postre también. Así que es muy divertido compartirla con la familia\", destaca Julmice. Ponche crema ¿Qué lo hace especial? Es la bebida navideña traída por la última ola de inmigrantes del sur de Florida. Otra interesante bebida navideña que llega al sur de Florida es el ponche crema, una bebida \"que se está volviendo mucho más popular entre muchos de nuestros amigos venezolanos que vienen aquí y traen sus propias versiones\", apunta Urrutia. Se crea con una mezcla de leche condensada azucarada, leche evaporada, ramas de canela, nuez moscada y -a diferencia del coquito- yemas de huevo. En cuanto al licor, hay opciones en cuanto a marcas. \"Venezuela también tiene una cultura del ron muy fuerte, ¿verdad? “Usaremos algunos de esos increíbles rones que hay en Venezuela para poder crear el ponche crema”, reconoce Urrutia. Ahora, lo más importante es que este ponche con leche también es un producto básico en la República Dominicana, donde Urrutia destaca que se elabora con el famoso ron Brugal de la isla. “Me encanta su diversidad. Es realmente genial ver rones de diferentes países [y una] versión diferente de los ingredientes”, explica. Cola de mono ¿Qué lo hace especial? Su nombre extravagante, el licor base y las variaciones de los ponches cremosos típicos. Desde su nombre hasta sus ingredientes, la cola de mono de Chile es algo único. Urrutia, que es mitad chileno, dice que esta bebida navideña, aunque tal vez no sea tan común como las otras en el sur de Florida, es especialmente digna de mención porque demuestra cómo nuestras comunidades de la diáspora se han aferrado a sus raíces y por qué somos mejores por ello. \"La cola de mono en realidad no usa crema, en realidad usa leche entera\", comienza Urrutia. Eso la hace menos cremosa, más aguada y potencialmente \"más atractiva para alguien que tal vez no quiera algo decadente\". Y su licor base no es el ron que nos hemos acostumbrado a ver en este informe. Es pisco, el licor blanco hecho de jugo de uva que también se asocia con frecuencia con Perú. Pero otros dos ingredientes también distinguen a este ponche especial: clavo de olor y café instantáneo. \"Ese café, ese pisco chileno, sabores realmente diferentes. Pero, por supuesto, las hermosas especias y esa cremosidad … realmente te dan ese abrazo navideño por dentro\", dice Urrutia. Crema de vie ¿Qué lo hace especial? Proviene de una de las comunidades más emblemáticas del sur de Florida, y el nombre muestra su estilo. A pesar de pertenecer a una de las comunidades de diáspora más grandes del sur de Florida, esta bebida puede ser menos conocida. Sí, la crema de vie es la bebida navideña tradicional cubana. En cuanto a por qué una frase francesa que se traduce literalmente como \"crema de la vida\" nombraría esta bebida, Urrutia, que también es mitad cubano, piensa que se trata más de actitud que de historia. \"Nos gustan las cosas buenas de la vida, esa es la belleza de eso\", dice. Este ponche se prepara con leche condensada azucarada, leche evaporada, azúcar, agua, vainilla, ron y -a diferencia del coquito- yemas de huevo. Coquito ¿Qué lo hace especial? Conocido en todas partes, es el que probablemente hayas probado, incluso si no eres puertorriqueño. Finalmente, volvemos al punto de partida, a la bebida que se prepara con esmero, se regala con cariño y se sirve con cuidado en los hogares, oficinas y eventos del sur de Florida durante las fiestas. A Puerto Rico, debemos ofrecer un sincero \"gracias\" por el coquito. Urrutia cree que debemos darle crédito a quien lo merece. Aquí, el coquito es el rey. \"Tienes esa sensación de \\'Oh, creo que los puertorriqueños tienen razón en esto\\'\", dice sobre la cultura de beber en las fiestas del sur de Florida. \"Lo que realmente me encanta de esto es que no es tanto como ir a mi bar a buscar mi coquito favorito\". En cambio, como el coquito está pensado para compartirse socialmente, significa que alguien tuvo que aprender una receta, embotellarla en un recipiente especial o en la botella de ron que se usó para prepararla -lo que en sí es un gesto casual pero vulnerable-, presentársela al anfitrión, tal vez incluso meterla en su refrigerador para mantenerla fría durante unas horas antes de finalmente abrirla para que todos la disfruten. Luego, probablemente hablarán sobre ello, discutirán y compararán -de manera un tanto competitiva- las recetas. \"El espíritu de la hospitalidad está en esa botella\", dice Urrutia. \"Lo creaste. Le dedicaste trabajo. Creaste este cóctel histórico. Puede ser, ya sabes, generacional. Puede provenir de miembros de la familia, o incluso de una receta que encontraste en Internet, pero el hecho de que hayas puesto todo ese esfuerzo para poder ir y abrirlo y servirlo, ¿no? Eso es increíble\". A estas alturas, los ingredientes del coquito sin huevo no deberían sorprenderte: leche evaporada, crema de coco, leche condensada dulce, vainilla, canela, nuez moscada y ron se combinan para crear una bebida con sabor a postre. Es íntima y placentera. \"Así que traer una botella [de cualquier bebida espirituosa] y simplemente dejarla en la encimera es genial. Gracias. Gracias por traer eso\", asiente Urrutia. \"Pero traer una botella [de coquito] que vamos a beber en un par de horas es aún mejor. Y eso es lo que hace que el ponche de huevo, la crema de vie, el coquito, la cola de mono, todo eso, sea tan, tan especial\".

       "  'text': 'Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Email Amid what has been portrayed as a “civil war” between the “MAGA Republicans and Big Tech,” over H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, an economic advisor to the Trump campaign has asserted that there is no better way than immigrants to make America great again. The restrictionists in President-elect Donald Trump’s Republican party want fewer visas, and the pro-growth wing wants more, Stephen Moore a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, noted in a commentary on Rasmussen Reports. READ: Elon Musk calls for major reform of H-1B visa program (December 30, 2024) The Trump campaign advisor noted that Trump himself has announced his support for expanding immigrant worker visas, telling the New York Post, “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them.” Despite some traditional nativist concerns that immigrants “take jobs from American workers,” the most recent meta-study published in 2020 by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that, on balance, immigrants are “job creators, not job takers,” Moore wrote citing former AOL CEO Steve Case. “That is because immigrants today as always have high rates of starting businesses, fill niches in the workforce, and create jobs with their purchases of American goods and services,” he stated. The nonpartisan American Immigration Council recently found that 45% of American Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants and their children, Moore noted. The businesses they create are not just in the tech sector, They include retail (Kohl’s), telecommunications (Verizon, AT&T), finance (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup), pharmaceuticals (Pfizer, Moderna), media (News Corp, Fox), transportation (Boeing, JetBlue) and petroleum (Phillips 66, Occidental Petroleum), to name a few. And let’s not forget Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX. The revenues of these first- and second-generation immigrant companies exceed that of any other nation, Moore noted. Elon Musk, who will co-chair the Department of Government Efficiency commission, says he thinks we should double visas for skilled immigrants “yesterday.” He added, “The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. … If you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be.” READ: Trump sides with Musk in H-1B war (December 29, 2024) “It is clear that hardworking and entrepreneurial immigrants in combination with good old Yankee ingenuity is one of the greatest comparative advantages the United States has over nearly every other nation in the world — especially China,” Moore stated asserting, “I can’t think of a better way to make America great again. Meanwhile, Newsweek cited a Rasmussen Reports poll conducted in November to suggest a majority of Americans opposes expansion of the H-1B visa program to address workforce shortages as suggested by Trump and Musk and favors domestic solutions to labor shortages. Newsweek said it has contacted Trump’s transition team for comment via email . The November poll, according to Newsweek, found that 60% of Americans believed the country already had enough talented people to train and recruit for higher-skill roles, while 26% supported increasing the number of foreign workers for such positions. According to the Rasmussen Reports poll, in addition to respondents saying the country had enough talented people for higher-skill roles, 59% believed companies facing shortages in sectors such as construction, manufacturing and hospitality should focus on raising wages and intensifying efforts to recruit unemployed Americans, even if it resulted in higher consumer prices. Only 24% of respondents supported recruiting foreign workers to keep costs down. Industries such as technology, finance and academia are among the most frequent participants in the H-1B visa program. In 2024, major corporations—including Amazon, Googleand Meta—secured thousands of H-1B visas. Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, reportedly brought hundreds of employees to the US through the program. immigration legal immigrants US economy',\n",

In the past four years, visitor numbers from India have increased by five times, and more than two million Indians traveled to the United States in the first eleven months of 2024, a 26% increase over the same period in 2023, according to an embassy release. Over five million Indians already have a nonimmigrant visa to visit the United States and each day the Mission issues thousands more. READ: What a second term for Donald Trump means for H-1B visa seekers (December 10, 2024) The Department of State completed a successful pilot program to renew H-1B visas in the United States this year.\\xa0 This allowed many specialty occupation workers from India to renew their visas without leaving the United States. This pilot program streamlined the renewal process for thousands of applicants, and the Department of State is working to formally establish a US-based renewal program in 2025, according to the release. The US Mission to India issued tens of thousands of immigrant visas, facilitating legal family reunification and the migration of skilled professionals. \\xa0These immigrant visa holders became permanent residents upon their arrival, adding to the already rich and sizable Indian diaspora community in the United States. The US Mission to India also provided more than 24,000 passports and other consular services to American citizens living and traveling in India.\\xa0 A new version of the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) debuted in 2024, making it easier for the embassy and consulates to contact American citizens during emergencies and send them safety and security alerts. Increased processing of thousands of interview waiver-eligible nonimmigrant visa applications each week made it quicker and easier than ever for Indians to renew their nonimmigrant visas, the embassy stated. By streamlining operations and utilizing global consular resources, the US Mission has been able to redirect its own resources to focus on in-person interviews, reducing wait times for all applicants. More Indian students than ever before now have US student visas.\\xa0 In 2024, India became the top sender of international students for the first time since the 2008/2009 academic year with more than 331,000 students overall studying in the United States.

Connecticut AG says he\\'ll be \\'first to sue\\' if Trump moves to end birthright citizenship by KRISTINA WATROBSKI | The National News Desk Tue, December 31st 2024 at 4:10 PM Updated Wed, January 1st 2025 at 6:33 PM Connecticut Attorney General William Tong (D) on November 12, 2024 in Stamford, Connecticut. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) TOPICS: Trump Birthright citizenship Connecticut AG William Tong Immigration Lawsuit Deportation Executive action HARTFORD, Conn. (TNND) — Connecticut Attorney General William Tong on Sunday said he\\'ll be the \"first to sue\" if President-elect Donald Trump fulfills a pledge to end birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship allows anyone born in the U.S. to automatically be designated a citizen. Trump has vowed to end the process once his second White House term begins, telling NBC News\\'s \"Meet the Press\" in early December he will utilize executive action if needed. \"I would be the first to sue,” Tong, a Democrat, told NBC News on Sunday of the promise. Tong explained to the network his parents immigrated to the U.S. from China and Taiwan, and he is the first member of his family to have been born in the U.S. “I grew up working side by side with my parents in our family’s Chinese restaurant, and in one generation I’ve gone from that Chinese restaurant kitchen to be the attorney general of the state of Connecticut,” he said. “That only happens one place in this world, and that’s in America.\" When reached for comment, Trump-Vance transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told The National News Desk (TNND) that Trump will \"unify the country through success.\" \"President Trump will serve ALL Americans, even those who did not vote for him in the election,\" Leavitt said in a statement. Trump\\'s vow on birthright citizenship comes as he and Tom Homan, his incoming border czar, also promise to crack down on illegal immigration. The president-elect said while campaigning he would launch the \"largest deportation program of criminals\" in U.S. history if elected. Trump confirmed via Truth Social in November his administration will utilize \"military assets\" to conduct mass deportations. Homan, who is the former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, told CNN in December at least 100,000 beds will also be needed in detention centers to carry out the program. During the same CNN interview, Homan told host Kaitlan Collins he doesn\\'t think birthright citizenship is \"enshrined\" in the Constitution. \"But then again, I\\'m not a constitutional scholar, we\\'ll let the courts decide that,\" he said . \"On the birthright citizenship, I\\'ll say this: It\\'s a major driver ... for illegal immigration.\" Multiple blue state attorneys general in November announced their plans to \"protect\" against the incoming Trump administration. New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office brought a civil fraud case against Trump, said during a press conference she will not “shrink” from the responsibility to protect New Yorkers’ rights. California Attorney General Rob Bonta promised during a November press conference of his own to “stand up for all people” regardless of “politics.” Stay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope Newsletter Sign up /sign-up © 2025 Sinclair, Inc.

(TNND) — Connecticut Attorney General William Tong on Sunday said he\\'ll be the \"first to sue\" if President-elect Donald Trump fulfills a pledge to end birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship allows anyone born in the U.S. to automatically be designated a citizen. Trump has vowed to end the process once his second White House term begins, telling NBC News\\'s \"Meet the Press\" in early December he will utilize executive action if needed. \"I would be the first to sue,” Tong, a Democrat, told NBC News on Sunday of the promise. Tong explained to the network his parents immigrated to the U.S. from China and Taiwan, and he is the first member of his family to have been born in the U.S. “I grew up working side by side with my parents in our family’s Chinese restaurant, and in one generation I’ve gone from that Chinese restaurant kitchen to be the attorney general of the state of Connecticut,” he said. “That only happens one place in this world, and that’s in America.\" When reached for comment, Trump-Vance transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told The National News Desk (TNND) that Trump will \"unify the country through success.\" \"President Trump will serve ALL Americans, even those who did not vote for him in the election,\" Leavitt said in a statement. Trump\\'s vow on birthright citizenship comes as he and Tom Homan, his incoming border czar, also promise to crack down on illegal immigration. The president-elect said while campaigning he would launch the \"largest deportation program of criminals\" in U.S. history if elected. Trump confirmed via Truth Social in November his administration will utilize \"military assets\" to conduct mass deportations. Homan, who is the former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, told CNN in December at least 100,000 beds will also be needed in detention centers to carry out the program. During the same CNN interview, Homan told host Kaitlan Collins he doesn\\'t think birthright citizenship is \"enshrined\" in the Constitution. \"But then again, I\\'m not a constitutional scholar, we\\'ll let the courts decide that,\" he said . \"On the birthright citizenship, I\\'ll say this: It\\'s a major driver ... for illegal immigration.\" Multiple blue state attorneys general in November announced their plans to \"protect\" against the incoming Trump administration. New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office brought a civil fraud case against Trump, said during a press conference she will not “shrink” from the responsibility to protect New Yorkers’ rights. California Attorney General Rob Bonta promised during a November press conference of his own to “stand up for all people” regardless of “politics.” Stay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope Newsletter Sign up /sign-up © 2025 Sinclair, Inc.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Share TOPICS: Trump Birthright citizenship Connecticut AG William Tong Immigration Lawsuit Deportation Executive action HARTFORD, Conn. (TNND) — Connecticut Attorney General William Tong on Sunday said he\\'ll be the \"first to sue\" if President-elect Donald Trump fulfills a pledge to end birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship allows anyone born in the U.S. to automatically be designated a citizen. Trump has vowed to end the process once his second White House term begins, telling NBC News\\'s \"Meet the Press\" in early December he will utilize executive action if needed. \"I would be the first to sue,” Tong, a Democrat, told NBC News on Sunday of the promise. Tong explained to the network his parents immigrated to the U.S. from China and Taiwan, and he is the first member of his family to have been born in the U.S. “I grew up working side by side with my parents in our family’s Chinese restaurant, and in one generation I’ve gone from that Chinese restaurant kitchen to be the attorney general of the state of Connecticut,” he said. “That only happens one place in this world, and that’s in America.\" When reached for comment, Trump-Vance transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told The National News Desk (TNND) that Trump will \"unify the country through success.\" \"President Trump will serve ALL Americans, even those who did not vote for him in the election,\" Leavitt said in a statement. Trump\\'s vow on birthright citizenship comes as he and Tom Homan, his incoming border czar, also promise to crack down on illegal immigration. The president-elect said while campaigning he would launch the \"largest deportation program of criminals\" in U.S. history if elected. Trump confirmed via Truth Social in November his administration will utilize \"military assets\" to conduct mass deportations. Homan, who is the former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, told CNN in December at least 100,000 beds will also be needed in detention centers to carry out the program. During the same CNN interview, Homan told host Kaitlan Collins he doesn\\'t think birthright citizenship is \"enshrined\" in the Constitution. \"But then again, I\\'m not a constitutional scholar, we\\'ll let the courts decide that,\" he said . \"On the birthright citizenship, I\\'ll say this: It\\'s a major driver ... for illegal immigration.\" Multiple blue state attorneys general in November announced their plans to \"protect\" against the incoming Trump administration. New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office brought a civil fraud case against Trump, said during a press conference she will not “shrink” from the responsibility to protect New Yorkers’ rights.

Will McGough writes about travel destinations and outdoor adventures. Following Dec 31, 2024, 06:16pm EST Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Aerial view of London and the Tower Bridge, England, United Kingdom. American travelers will now need to apply for an ETA before arrival. getty Beginning January 8th, 2025, Americans headed to London, or anywhere in the United Kingdom, will have to file for an ETA —an electronic travel authorization—before arrival. It is not technically a visa, and the U.K. Visas and Immigration Office makes that clear, since it does not replace any existing visa requirements for travelers from countries who require them. But, it sort of acts like one for American travelers, since we previously were not required to have any paperwork or incur any cost when entering the U.K. American travelers will now have to pay $10 to apply for the ETA, and every traveler, regardless of age, must obtain one before being granted access to the country (adults can apply on behalf of children and the elderly). No refunds are given. The ETA will give each traveler up to 6 months in the U.K. for “tourism, visiting family and friends, business or short-term study.” To apply, you’ll need your passport, a payment method, and access to an email account. Travelers need to upload photos of their passport as well as their face as part of the application. The decision on the application will come in three days or less. If approved, the ETA is valid for two years, and you can travel to the U.K. as many times as you want during that time (but not longer than six months). If you need to travel spontaneously, you can travel to the U.K. while your ETA application is pending, but you must apply before you depart the United States. The U.K. Visas and Immigration Office created an app where travelers can apply for the ETA. You can learn more about the application process here . Overall, it’s not the end of the world, but American travelers should be aware of the added cost and, moreso, that they need to remember to do it before crossing the pond.

       "  'text': 'Local News Elections, fires, health debates, tattoos, and opera all made for robust stories in 2024 KUNM Published\\xa0December 31, 2024 at 4:58 PM MST Facebook Email Print Jeanette Dedios / KUNM Supporters wave signs at a campaign rally for now President-elect Donald Trump\\'s in Albuquerque, N.M., on Oct. 31, 2024. The KUNM news team worked incredibly hard this past year and we wanted to highlight some of our favorite stories as we say goodbye to 2024. Alice Fordham Two years on from historic fire, northern New Mexico communities wait for help to rebuild In 2022, the Calf Canyon/Hermit\\'s Peak fire burned hundreds of homes, after two U.S. Forest Service prescribed burns went awry. The federal government promised billions of dollars to compensate devastated communities, and in this story I looked at how slowly that\\'s coming to people. I\\'ve stayed in touch with several people whose lives were changed forever by the fire, and this story was part of holding the Federal Emergency Management Agency accountable for helping them. Megan Gleason / Source New Mexico Remnants of a house that the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burned up are surrounded by dead trees in Mora County. Pictured on Sept. 12, 2022. Trump comes to New Mexico, where Republicans are courting Hispanic voters hard In the run-up to the election, I started calling around Democratic local officials in Northern New Mexico and was surprised by what I heard. They were concerned that people in their communities, especially younger people and Hispanic people, were drifting toward Trump and the Republican party. So, I took a look at state races, and saw that in the races the Republicans lost most narrowly last time, they were running Hispanic candidates this time around. Then, I spoke to Republican candidates and strategists about their concerted push to make gains among Hispanic voters. When Trump decided to visit New Mexico, it made a lot of sense in that context. When he touched down, he said, \"I’m here for one simple reason. I like you very much, and it’s good for my credentials with the Hispanic or Latino community.\" Though the state ultimately stayed mainly blue, it looked a lot purpler than 2022, and with record numbers of Hispanic, Republican state lawmakers elected. Alice Fordham / KUNM The prickly pear cactus, or opuntia Albuquerque prickly pear festival celebrates abundance of the desert This was a chance to take listeners on a fun day out with me, of music and food and celebration of a native plant. The organizers of this prickly pear festival want people to reconnect to local foods and traditions for a more sustainable life. Mia Casas The art of opera flourishing at Albuquerque Academy This story was an opportunity to combine so many of my passions into one area. A secret fact about me is that I am classically trained in opera! I have been a performer for over a decade now, and when a teacher pitched us this story about a middle school opera club, I was more than intrigued. It was remarkably fun to watch these kids write, direct and produce a full opera. Getting to know young folks who still have passion for classical art was inspiring. New initiative takes on harm reduction in Albuquerque’s music scene I was excited to highlight this unique initiative through a radio story. The underground music scene has historically had a bad reputation surrounding drug use and harm. The Punk Safety Initiative is trying to change that reputation and provide harm-reduction tools to this community. The team is made up of medical students and is now an official nonprofit providing safe use kits, condoms, emergency contraceptives, and other products to reduce harm in the community. Mia Casas / KUNM Projection of tattoo ceremony at Casa Barelas by Ray Kim. Artist explores healing through pain in new book People often think of tattoos as taboo and certainly not healing. One tattoo artist in Albuquerque is trying to change that narrative. Through her book “Sublime Hallucinations ,” Ray Kim explores how tattoos can heal emotional pain and trauma through medicine, ritual, and intention. I got to attend her book release and live tattooing ceremony, as well as interview her privately about this process and her book. Nash Jones Organ donations hit a record high in NM, but the wait for kidneys remains above average This story began when my neighbor Scott Plunket put a giant sign in his yard that said “I need a kidney!” I had to know more, so I knocked on his door. Scott told me about his quest for a live kidney donor while he sat on the waitlist for a deceased donor. I also met Renee Roybal of San Ildefonso, who received a heart transplant in a way that aligned with Pueblo cultural traditions around a body remaining intact for burial. They shared their unique experiences with the process during a year of record organ donation facilitated by New Mexico Donor Services. Barbara Ramirez Matthew Finch kept his Ear to the Ground: Remembering KUNM’s longtime music director Our team at KUNM and the New Mexico music community lost a dear friend and local music champion in Matthew Finch this year. It was my honor to speak with his family, friends and colleagues about the impact his life and work had on all of us. He is deeply missed while his legacy lives on at KUNM and beyond. City officials say Albuquerque’s ‘sanctuary city’ status can withstand federal pressure After Donald Trump was reelected, I took on a series looking at how New Mexico state and city officials were preparing for his next term, particularly his promise to enact mass deportations. In this story, I focused on the City of Albuquerque, where there is a sanctuary city policy that prevents local cooperation with federal immigration officials. I believe it was important to let concerned community members know what the city’s top officials were considering in the lead up to potential deportations and what they do and do not have the power to do. Bryce Dix Bryce Dix / KUNM Red tinted coal gob can be seen on the eastern hill slopes leading into the town of Madrid. Stormwater erosion snakes underneath the hills. How one historic New Mexico mining town is balancing its legacy, tourism, and the climate crisis For those who don’t know, Madrid, New Mexico is one heck of a town. Not only is it the site of one of the oldest coal mining regions in the state, but its large piles of toxic mining waste actually gives residents a serious economic boon for their stark Western aesthetic – attracting both film and tourism dollars. And, naturally, they want to keep it that way. When I heard that the state was putting millions of dollars into a project meant to keep these piles of eroding legacy waste from sweeping into the town’s homes from torrential rains, I had to check it out. This is an example of a process that’s rare nowadays: compromise, trust-building, and problem-solving by the public and state government. Beavers could be the key to fighting climate change in the Southwest I love this story for lots of reasons. I mean, who doesn’t love beavers? Right now, advocates are actively pushing to reintroduce the semi-aquatic rodent into New Mexico’s streams and rivers in the name of the environment. Turns out these small-but-mighty critters have a lot going for them – from fighting wildfires to filtering out pollutants and improving water quality with their dams. Surprised, I decided to take a little road trip to the Jemez Mountains to take a closer look at recovery efforts. This is one of those stories where you\\'ll hear everything that makes radio magical — laughter, the steady trickle of a stream, and the familiar sinking squish of mud under a boot. Climate stories are often full of doom and gloom, but this one is much different. An audio postcard from the Caja del Rio plateau A personal favorite of mine, this audio postcard transports you right into the passenger seat of a pickup truck driving across the Caja del Rio plateau. Nestled just outside of Santa Fe, the Caja is the proposed site of a hotly contested 115kV transmission line by Los Alamos National Laboratories. I’ve closely followed this story for over a year now and have slowly seen efforts to conserve this sacred (and might I say beautiful) piece of land garner serious attention. Most recently, New Mexico’s congressional delegation called on President Joe Biden to designate it a national monument. In my previous reporting, LANL officials told me I should see the Caja for myself and through this story, you can too. Jeanette DeDios Jeanette DeDios / KUNM-FM Shelly Belin, (right) manager of the Mescalero tribal fish hatchery, talks with other volunteers about donated clothing items. Mescalero Apache members speak out on the impact of the South Fork and Salt fires The South Fork and Salt fires came as a surprise to many and that was no different for the KUNM team. We only had a handful of reporters available at the time so we were all working at high capacity. Something that was very clear was that most news outlets were only focusing on Ruidoso and not the Mescalero Apache reservation, which was also feeling the impacts of the fire. I volunteered to travel down to the reservation to talk to members of the community to discuss some of the challenges they were facing. While I was driving down, I was having doubts if anyone would be willing to talk to me in such an urgent time. But to my surprise, I was met with smiles, laughter, and volunteers sorting donations, preparing food, and even asking me if I needed anything. The resistance and resilience of the community to help their own and others is what I took away from this assignment. Jeanette DeDios / KUNM-FM Republican Native American voters Jen Thomasik and Brandy Ross stand outside the Trump rally held in Albuquerque, NM. Native American voters weigh in on this election As a team, KUNM had been covering the election for months and on the heels of election day, President-elect Donald Trump decided to hold a rally in Albuquerque. This was my first time covering a rally and whether Trump was going to be the next president or not, it felt like a once-in-a-lifetime event as a reporter. I had been trying to gain input from the Indigenous community on where they stand between Trump and Harris. Of the people I interviewed at prior election events, I only heard people planning to vote for Harris. This rally was a great opportunity to find Native voters whose beliefs aligned with Trump and were planning to vote for him. Getting their perspective helped bring balance to the overall story about where Native American voters stood in the election. Local Diné author on the rise in Indigenous representation and supporting Native voices in media The most enjoyable interviews are the ones that don’t feel like work. And this story was certainly that; when I talked with local author Ramona Emerson, it felt like I was talking to an old friend. The hardest part was taking a 30 minute interview and cutting it down to 5 ½ minutes. There was so much that Emerson had to say about how Native Americans are portrayed in today’s media, both the good and the bad. And as a fellow filmmaker and writer, she is such an inspiration and I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to interview her on her newest book “Exposure,” a sequel to her first book, “Shutter.” For Native and non-Natives alike, this interview is likely to stir your creative juices and inspire you to start a new project. Daniel Montaño NHD / Stephanie Wilson The New Mexico team show off their hometown pride during the 2024 National History Day national competitions in Washington D.C., which is the culmination of a year-long research project meant to help the kids grow, learn, and develop skills that make them informed citizens. Research competition teaches kids more than history As a public health reporter, sometimes I get caught up reporting negative news, but this was a blast to report on, and included so many great moments, mainly because it includes kids — precocious, intelligent and driven kids. They’re part of National History Day , a nonprofit organization that runs a research competition to get kids excited to learn, and seeks to create well-informed and engaged citizens who can place their society in a broader context. State’s only detox for young people set to open If you were under the age of 18 and dealing with addiction issues before this year, there weren’t any official options to medically detox in New Mexico outside of a hospital. Now Serenity Mesa has a detox on their campus for kids as young as 14, which advocates have been working toward for years. This story was touching to report on. While touring their campus, a young woman who was living there while going through their rehabilitation program interrupted the interview to make sure I knew how much she loved the people and the place itself. Controversial behavioral health law sparks strong responses from supporters and critics alike This ordinance to create a central behavioral health care authority in Bernanillio county proved to be much more divisive than initial reporting would suggest. It was heavily supported by behavioral health providers outside of Bernalillo County’s control, but was absolutely abhorred by behavioral health workers employed by Bernco. This story did not get much attention, besides a cursory review of the bill, prior to my coverage, despite the fact that county employees were very loud about their concerns, which included fear for their safety. Taylor Velazquez Taylor Velazquez / KUNM Cindy Nava speaks to a group of refugees and immigrants recently at Albuquerque High School. Democratic State Senate candidate Cindy Nava could be first former DACA recipient to win elected office In the run-up to the election, I had the opportunity to closely follow one race, State Senate District 9. The race was a tense one between Democrat Cindy Nava and Republican challenger Audrey Trujillo. Trujillo was not a new face to New Mexico politics as she most notably ran for Secretary of State in 2020. However, Trujillo lost that race and while her social media accounts had posts that were anti-Semitic, she would deny reposting them and said her account must have been hacked. Later she admitted that she didn’t think the intentions of the post were racist. Democrat Cindy Nava drew immense national interest, with NPR reaching out to KUNM for a national story on her. When Nava was a child she was brought to the U.S. from Mexico and she would later receive the federal program benefit of Deferred Action for\\xa0 Childhood Arrivals that allowed her the right to live in the country, go to school, and work without the fear of deportation. Later on\\xa0 she would go on to participate in the New Mexico Legislature on policy decisions concerning scholarships for DACA recipients, work in education policy, and would become the first former DACA recipient to receive a White House political appointment and chose to spend her time in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\\xa0 Nava became a U.S. citizen three years agoThe Senate District 9 race made history, as Nava became one of the first former DACA recipients to win public office. Leticia Archuleta / Health Leadership High School Students at the Health Leadership High School. Local charter school has creative plans in getting young people engaged in healthcare careers As one of the poverty and public health reporters at KUNM funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, a big focus area for me this year was the health care worker shortage crisis. In the past, I’ve covered other public health issues like child welfare, poverty, and education, but after digging into this workforce shortage, I found connections among all these issues given long waiting times to see a doctor and how the lack of health care access leads to dangerous outcomes.\\xa0A local charter school, Health Leadership High School, also saw the parallels as well and began to work to get young people interested in medicine. This type of program is integral in helping with the shortage of these workers. The school’s curriculum allows students to apply their studies to the real world, even having paid internships. The school believes that these initiatives will keep young people here to serve their own communities while helping out with the state’s systemic challenges when it comes to education attainment. Albuquerque Public Schools reports progress in reducing chronic absenteeism One of the issues I’ve covered extensively is chronic absenteeism, especially post-pandemic. Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, participated in the Every Day Counts Summit, hosted by the White House, where they reported a decrease of chronic absenteeism this year, after they implemented several initiatives and prioritized community building both inside and outside the school. While sometimes it does feel the news cycle is only reporting the negatives going on in the state, it is always great to highlight any progress that has been made, especially when it comes to issues of education. Megan Kamerick Christy Linder / Project Street Vet Dr. Kwane Stewart treats pets belonging to people are facing housing challenges or living on the street. UNM grad named CNN Hero of the Year for his work as a street vet As news director, I’m not doing much reporting these days since a lot of my time is helping others do their reporting and edit their stories. But I still take some time to do interviews, including on University Showcase, the monthly show I’ve hosted for years. One of my favorites was with Kwane Stewart. The UNM grad works as a street veterinarian and I found his work so inspirational. I volunteer at a soup kitchen and I meet a lot of folks living on the streets with animals, mostly dogs. I feel badly for the pets knowing the challenges they face, but he helped me realize how much they are loved. For some of these folks, these companions have been the difference between living and giving up. Are you searching for friends and family in the South Fork or Salt fires? Find and leave messages here. We were not fully staffed when the South Fork and Salt Fires broke out, and the distance was also challenging for us in terms of coverage. But one of our collaborators, Source New Mexico, had folks on the ground there and the editor at the time, Shaun Griswold, told me people could not reach one another due to the cell phone towers being destroyed. He asked me to set up a hotline, which I’d never done, but I got a Google Voice number and we started putting out the word to call us with messages for loved ones. I spent a solid day answering messages and getting out information. It was exhausting but one of the most fulfilling things I’ve done in a long time. Our effort was highlighted by America Amplified . Milton Jack Snow / Maxwell Museum of Anthropology Buddy Smith and his family on the Navajo Nation \\'Nothing Left For Me\\' focuses on the trauma brought by the Navajo Livestock Reduction Program For me the best part of being a journalist is that I’m always learning. I love this, even when I learn things that are deeply disturbing. I did a show focusing on this exhibit at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology about an episode in our history I’m pretty sure many people have never heard about. The federal government forced Navajo families to give up huge parts of their livestock, nominally as a tool to address the soil erosion that contributed to the Dust Bowl. But in reality, it was another tool to control and mainstream Native Americans. We all need to understand our history, unvarnished, if we are to move forward and create a more just society and this was a story that really brought that home for me. But also, I loved that the curators focused on the amazing resilience of these communities. That’s part of telling the complete story of colonization.',\n",

       "  'text': 'As NewsBusters has shown over the last week, the Cackling Coven of ABC’s The View has said a lot of things throughout 2024, most of them pretty negative and heinous; racist things, incendiary things, made bad predictions about the election, attacked voters, tried to stir up fear , tried to prop up the Democratic ticket, and morally repugnant things. That’s why we’re wrapping up our 2024 retrospective with a look at some of the laughably dumbest things they’ve said. From talk about Nikki Haley’s vagina to dogs biting butts, to them “leaking” with excitement, to claiming the solar eclipse was caused by climate change, this is a collection of some of the most mind numbing, jaw dropping, head scratching, and room-temperature I.Q. things they’ve said over the course of 2024. Proceed with caution as, presented in chronological order, are some pretty braindead comments. Sunny Hostin: ‘Last I Checked’ Nikki Haley ‘Has a Vagina’ Like Hillary Clinton We’re going to start his countdown in January, when Sunny Hostin bitterly lashed out at former Ambassador Nikki Haley in a way that left even her fellow cast members perplexed. In trying to chide Haley’s support among women, Hostin seemed to suggest she’s looked at Haley’s vagina: I don\\'t understand why everyone is backing Nikki Haley especially women. I remember when Hillary Clinton was running, there was a lot of talk about ‘I don\\'t vote for someone just because she has a vagina.’ Well, last I checked Nikki Haley has one too. Co-host Joy Behar asked the question that was likely on the minds of most viewers: “What do you mean, the last you checked?!” “Sunny is full of surprises,” she quipped. Joy Behar: Charlie Chaplin’s Comedy Created Hitler and the Holocaust While attempting to once again equate President-elect Trump with Adolf Hitler, Behar (a comedian) came out against comedy because it supposedly made Trump run for president. “He is one of the most dangerous people of my lifetime to ever be in the Oval Office,” she warned. “And he doesn\\'t have a good sense of humor. We all know at the correspondents’ dinner, when president Obama made a joke about him.” She then blamed Charlie Chaplin’s comedy for creating Hitler and bringing about the Holocaust: “They made fun of Hitler. Charlie Chaplin made fun of Hitler in 1940, by 1945 millions and millions were dead!” In reality, Hitler became chancellor in 1933 and became Fuhrer in 1934. He invaded Poland in 1939, which historians agree marked the start of WWII. And while the Wannsee Conference (the 90-minute meeting to plan what would become known as the Holocaust) did occur in 1942, Hitler’s marginalization of Jews in German started when the Nazis took power in 1933. Additionally, some of the concentration camps were already in operation as prisons prior to the conference. ‘I Know History!’ Joy Behar Thinks NATO Fought Hitler and the Nazis in WWII Keeping the focus on Behar’s understanding (or rather, misunderstanding) of WWII history, she would later falsely insist that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the military alliance that fought and defeated Hitler and the Nazis in WWII. Ironically, it her flub came after she declared “I know history”: Because I know history. And Putin will not stop at Ukraine if they don\\'t -- if we don\\'t help them. And Trump is saying he\\'ll pull out of NATO. These are allies. We were all in this together in World War II, and now he’s going to pull out of this?! Outrageous! If WWII was Behar’s only frame of reference, she might be very surprised to learn who some of our NATO allies were (HINT: they’re former Axis Powers! ) \"I know history!\" Joy Behar thinks NATO was the military alliance that fought against Hitler and the Nazis. pic.twitter.com/cSBnZhCrFJ — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) February 16, 2024 ‘Imma Bite Your Ass!’ The View Defends Biden’s Dog Attacking 24 People In late February, when news broke that President Biden’s undisciplined dog, Commander had attacked 24 people (and still wasn’t put down), the cast took to defending the vicious attacks. They collectively claimed he was picking up on suspicious people that the Secret Service wasn’t (despite most of his victims being said agents). “Well, it makes you wonder. What did he see that nobody else saw?” moderator Whoopi Goldberg declared. Goldberg then pretending to be Commander and started talking about how she was going to “Imma bite your ass” (Click “expand”): GOLDBERG: All you have to do is look at him. HOSTIN: Look at him! GOLDBERG: Can you show that picture again? HOSTIN: Look at his little [inaudible] GOLBERG: He’s like, “That’s right. I\\'m walking. I’m walking here. I\\'m walking here, woo, woo.” HOSTIN: Listen to his name, “Commander!” He’s in charge! GOLDBERG: “Imma bite your ass! Woo, woo!” HOSTIN: He’s a guard dog! The View: ‘Everyone Belongs at a Drag Show!’ ‘Everybody’ Wears Drag! The View has been a big proponent of the degeneracy known as drag shows and have been a big proponent of parents taking kids to see them. During a RuPaul guest appearance, co-host Sara Haines insisted that “everyone belongs at a drag show” and RuPaul claimed everyone (including you, reader) wears drag already: HAINES: None that I\\'ve seen. [laughter] But this is all happening while simultaneously we\\'re watching some places in this country ban drag shows. Now, I want to know your thoughts because to me having -- One of the things that appeals about a drag show and often the community, this is a community that took time to find clarity to see themselves to be authentic when it wasn\\'t one actor on the stage, they had to pave their own way. So, I\\'ve always found everyone belongs at a drag show. What do you think of this? CHARLES: Well, listen, you\\'re born naked and the rest is drag. Everybody is playing a role, everyone. When you get out of the shower you put on your drag. Right? Sunny Hostin Claims the Solar Eclipse, Earthquake Caused by ‘Climate Change’ Observing all the dumb things they said in 2024, this is arguably the dumbest. Just because you graduated from Binghamton University and Notre Dame Law School and were a former federal prosecutor, it doesn’t make you intelligent. Co-host Sunny Hostin proved that April, when she asserted that the solar eclipse, the New Jersey earthquake, and the cicada brood were caused by climate change. Her co-hosts were barely equipped to explain to her how solar eclipse are calculable, how plate tectonics work, or the life cycle of annoying insects: HOSTIN: All those things together, would maybe lead one to believe that either climate change exists, or something is really going on. BEHAR: That’s more on point. ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN: Or Jesus is returning. BEHAR: Except earthquakes are not at the mercy of climate change. It\\'s underground. It can’t. HOSTIN: How about the warming of the planet? GOLDBERG: No, it happens. And the eclipse, they\\'ve known about the eclipse coming because eclipses happen and they actually can say when these things are going to happen. Navarro Defends Menendez, Blames Wife, Argues ‘Costco Sells Gold Bars’ When now-former Democratic Senator Bob Menendez (NJ) was formally charged with corruption, fake Republican co-host Ana Navarro did more than just mourn for her friend; she defending him by blaming his wife and pointed to Costco. She even bragged about bringing her wealthy clients to see him: His trial begins in a couple of weeks, I think, in two or three weeks. And look, and every time we talk about this I always want to start by saying, I think I\\'m biased. I try to be objective but I\\'ve known Bob Menendez for almost 30 years. I’ve worked with him on countless issues, Cuba, Nicaragua, immigration, Central American free trade. This Menendez that I read about here just does not jive, does not square away with the man I\\'ve known for all of this time. It\\'s hard for me to understand all of these facts. I’ve went to him with 100 issues with very rich clients, he never ever did anything like this. The View Was \\'Leaking\\' in Excitement After Trump Was Found Guilty, Want Prison Things got gross in May after Trump was found guilty on 34 felonies in the politically motivated hush money case against him. In addition to Goldberg making a rare appearance on a Friday show to celebrate the news, Behar gave the audience too much information when so admitted to “leaking” in the aisle of her local Costco when she was notified of the development: BEHAR: Well, my reaction I was at Costco buying ten boxes of Keurig coffee and my watch started to buzz and I got so excited I started leaking a little bit. [Laughter] But wait, this is what I had to say! GOLDBERG: So, you\\'re the leaker. BEHAR: I\\'m the leaker. The View Has Suspicion COVID’s Origin ‘Wasn’t in this Country,’ Maybe a Lab No one has ever accused The View of being on top of the news. The year was 2024 and the liberal ladies were only now getting suspicions that COVID’s origins weren’t in the U.S. and that it was possibly from a lab: HOSTIN: They say they cannot find out what happened here in the United States in terms of the origin of COVID. Well, maybe because the origin wasn\\'t in this country. Maybe it was in another country and maybe they need to now start looking for – at other countries. BEHAR: Didn’t they say it possibly came out of a lab? HOSTIN: Yes. Whoopi: We Don’t Allow Lies on The View This one is extremely laughable. Goldberg claimed they never lie on the show because it’s something they just “can’t have” going on: Now we all have -- we have been given doubts that people don\\'t know how to do this. The media has pretty much always been fair to each side, and now when we\\'ve gone to this place where you only hear this -- see, we have to tell you both sides. That\\'s why Alyssa\\'s here. That\\'s why Ana\\'s here, because we don\\'t all think the same way, and it\\'s like you all. You all don\\'t think the same way so you want to hear what other people say, but when they\\'re lying, we can\\'t have it. We can\\'t allow on this show to have things said that we know for a fact are not true. That\\'s what it used to be. That\\'s what it needs to go back to being, and that\\'s where y\\'all come in. It\\'s okay to feel how you feel, but demand the truth. Demand folk’s fact check what they\\'re telling you because what they’re telling you is important. The View Brags About How Easy It Would Be to Cheat on Their Husbands While not politics related, the ladies of The View disclosed a lot about themselves when they bragged about how easy it would be to get away with cheating on their husbands; and giving their men possibly enough justification to hire private investigators (Click “expand”):: ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN: I would preface this to say: My husband is the love of my life, I would never cheat on him, but I could absolutely get away with it! (...) HAINES: I get a haircut and my husband doesn\\'t notice. He\\'s looking at my face. And the other thing is, Max will may coffee – there are days I\\'ve come down to the coffee machine and there\\'s no coffee in it, it’s just hot water. Or he’ll leave the pot out and it’s all coffee on the counter. He – Like, if he doesn\\'t finish what he\\'s doing and pay attention he\\'s like a little nutty. (...) NAVARRO: Al, if he\\'s watching football, like if he\\'s watching the Dolphins, I could literally bring a man into the house, have him in his bed, and if the Dolphins win he could probably spend the night and Al wouldn\\'t even know. Ana Navarro: You ‘Can’t Be Relaxing and Enjoying Christmas’ Because Trump Their idiocy continued straight into the Christmas season with Navarro having an absolute mental breakdown as she shouted about how “winter is coming” and people shouldn’t be relaxing and enjoying the holiday with their loved ones because Trump was returning to office. Her Trump Derangement syndrome was on full display: NAVARRO: If you are an illegal immigrant in this country, you\\'re not going to be not in panic!

       "  'text': \"Politics Dems urge Biden to preserve immigration program that prevents deportations to certain countries — before Trump can cut it By Victor Nava Published Dec. 31, 2024 Updated Dec. 31, 2024, 10:08 p.m. ET Several Senate Democrats implored President Biden earlier this month to take action to preserve a controversial immigration program that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to wind down when he takes office. “As Senators who represent diverse states across our nation and who collectively represent millions of immigrant families, we write to express our deep concern about the threat the incoming administration poses to immigrants in our communities,” Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IIl), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) wrote in a Dec. 10 letter to Biden. The senators argue that Trump’s pledge to embark on a mass deportation initiative will “jeopardize the safety and security of millions of mixed-status families, sow deep distrust and fear in the communities we represent, and destabilize the U.S. economy” and demand that Biden, 82, act fast to further entrench programs that allowed record numbers of migrants to flow into the US under his administration. 4 The Temporary Status Program was established in the 1990s. Getty Images 4 The Biden administration re-designated a number of countries for TPS, including Haiti, Venezuela, and Afghanistan.

Gregory P. Mango The programs are intended to be used in cases where suffering and unrest is so great in a migrant’s home country that it would be unsafe to deport them back. The Biden administration has designated or re-designated several countries for TPS since 2021, including Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan. 4 Democrats have been urging Biden to extend protections under TPS. Robert Mecea The 17-country list of TPS-designated nations also includes: Myanmar, Cameroon, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Honduras, Lebanon, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. The Democratic senators contend that “worsening crises in countries across the world” underscore “the need for TPS.” The lawmakers also suggest that the Biden administration should add the Democratic Republic of Congo to the list of TPS nations. “We urge your administration to offer vital protections via TPS for eligible countries or parts of countries, providing relief from deportation while allowing these individuals to continue working and contributing to our economy,” the senators ask Biden. “Where TPS is not an option, we strongly urge the administration to protect qualified vulnerable noncitizens through DED.” During his first term, Trump sought to remove the TPS designations of several countries, such as Haiti, but a series of lawsuits thwarted him from doing so. TPS became a hot-button issue on the 2024 campaign trail amid reports that Haitian migrants were overwhelming towns like Springfield, Ohio , leading Trump to pledge to revoke TPS for Haiti. “It’s been overrun,” the president-elect said of the Ohio town in an October interview with NewsNation. “You can’t do that to people. I’d revoke [TPS], and I’d bring [the migrants] back to their country.” Filed under democrats donald trump immigration joe biden migrants 12/31/24 Read Next GOP lawmakers slam Biden for allowing 9/11 terrorists to s...

       "  'text': \"President Jimmy Carter at his desk in the Oval Office prior to delivering a speech on April 19, 1977. Charles W. Harrity/AP Editor’s Note: A version of this story published last year after President Carter entered hospice care. CNN — Steps that Jimmy Carter took during his presidency are still shaping the United States, decades after he left office. But they didn’t help him at the polls. Because of Carter’s actions, hundreds of thousands of people fleeing persecution had a chance to come to the United States when he was commander-in-chief. And millions more resettled in the US after he left office. “He was well aware of the political cost,” says Carter biographer Kai Bird, author of “The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter.” When it came to taking on tough issues, Bird says, Carter didn’t shy away from doing what he thought was right. And that’s where Carter found himself in the summer of 1979, making a decision that went against what polls said that most Americans wanted. Most Americans disapproved. Carter still took this step The scenes from the other side of the world were devastating. Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing government oppression in Southeast Asia were taking to the sea, and many were drowning as they tried to escape. A crisis that began before Carter took office was becoming increasingly dire by the day. In 1978, Carter ordered American ships to pick up refugees fleeing by boat. A year later, the exodus had only intensified. And as world leaders met to discuss top issues facing their countries, Carter took a dramatic stand, announcing the US would double the number of refugees accepted monthly from the region from 7,000 to 14,000. The move, according to news reports at the time, was aimed at pushing other countries to take similarly significant steps. Many of the refugees who left Vietnam in the years after Saigon fell fled on boats and found safe harbor, like the group pictured here in 1978. But thousands did not survive the journey. Fred Ihrt/LightRocket/Getty Images It was not politically popular. As writer Thu-Huong Ha noted in a 2016 piece for Quartz, a poll from CBS and The New York Times showed that 62% of Americans disapproved. And a Gallup poll indicated 57% of Americans were opposed to the US relaxing its immigration policies for refugees from the region. Carter did it anyway. “We are prepared to act with the compassion that has traditionally characterized the United States when confronted with such situations of human crisis,” Carter said in a statement released by the White House as he announced the new policy. “Thousands of human lives are at stake.” She says her family found freedom because of Carter’s ‘political courage’ Bee Nguyen says it’s something her family never forgot. “My mom is what you would consider apolitical. My father is conservative. … (President Carter) was the one political person that both my parents spoke about with respect and fondness, and still do to this day,” says Nguyen, a former Georgia state representative. That respect, Nguyen says, was earned by actions that Carter took that changed the course of her parents’ lives. Nguyen says her parents fled Vietnam by boat in 1978. A Thai fisherman rescued them, she says, and they spent months in refugee camps in Thailand. “My parents, they risked their lives. They left a country in which they experienced the loss of civil liberties, in which my father was incarcerated by his own government. And they were in search of freedom,” Nguyen says. They found it in Iowa, where they moved in 1979. “They were only able to do so because of the political courage exercised by President Carter,” she says. As #AAPIHeritageMonth comes to a close, I honor every day: my father – he served in the Vietnamese army, was imprisoned by his government & built a life in America as an engineer & pharmacist. My mother – she helped facilitate her family's escape by boat & raised 5 daughters. ♥️ pic.twitter.com/VZa8vYxQIj — Bee Nguyen 🐝 (@BeeForGeorgia) May 25, 2023 Nguyen was born a few years later, and she says what she heard about Carter growing up – and about Iowa’s then-governor, Republican Robert Ray, who also made a point of welcoming refugees – shaped her own views about America. To Nguyen, the stand Carter and other politicians took is just as important today as it was when her parents first arrived. Over the years, Americans’ views on their responsibilities toward refugees have fluctuated. In 2022, 72% of Americans said taking in refugees from countries where people are trying to escape violence and war should be a very or somewhat important goal for US immigration policy, according to a Pew Research Center survey , but opinions varied widely by party, race and ethnicity. “It’s important for us to learn as a country, to remember and understand that we as a nation from a values perspective and by law … we promised as a nation to be a safe harbor for people who are fleeing, for people whose lives are in danger,” she says. Carter’s fateful decision that summer of 1979 wasn’t the only step he took in that direction. Carter signed a law that paved the way for millions of people to come to the US On the frigid day when Faith Akovi Cooper first set foot in the United States with her mother and siblings, Carter was no longer in office. But she says she sees a direct connection between the former US president and the life she’s led since that day in January 1993. Back then, she was a refugee who’d fled war in Liberia. And thanks to a law Carter signed, the Refugee Act of 1980, her family was able to move to Reston, Virginia. The law, signed by President Carter in March 1980, created the framework that’s used to help those fleeing persecution around the world seek a better life in the United States. “My family is here today as a result of that act,” Cooper says. And now, as the International Rescue Committee’s regional director for resettlement, asylum and integration in the Southern US border region, she says she’s even more aware of how vast the law’s impact has been. “Millions of people have had the chance to rebuild their lives in the United States,” Cooper says. This family photo taken in Liberia shows Faith Akovi Cooper, right, and her mother, Abena Clement. Cooper says all the mementos from her childhood were lost when her home was destroyed during Liberia's civil war, but a family member gave her this photo shortly after she arrived in the United States. Courtesy Faith Cooper She was one of them. Rebuilding her life in the US included pursuing a career in global health and eventually going on to work for a leading refugee resettlement organization. More than 3 million refugees have come to the United States since 1980, including such well-known figures as actor Mila Kunis, singer Regina Spektor and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. “Millions are taxpaying Americans who have contributed greatly to our communities and to our economy,” Carter said in a 2021 statement commemorating the act’s anniversary. More than 125,000 refugees from Southeast Asia had fled to the US in the immediate aftermath of Saigon’s fall, and even more would come during Carter’s presidency. While fewer refugees came to the US annually after Carter left office, the country’s refugee resettlement program created by the 1980 act became a sought-after pathway. The law officially defined a refugee as someone with a “well-founded fear of persecution,” nearly tripled the number refugees the United States would accept and created a process for adjusting that number in emergencies. “Desperate refugees were drowning and dying from exposure at our doorstep, yet the United States lacked a legal structure to receive them in an orderly way,” Carter said in 2021. While Carter’s earlier move to welcome more refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos wasn’t politically popular, the Refugee Act sailed to approval in Congress with nearly unanimous support. “This was a humanitarian crisis, which Republicans and Democrats agreed on. And even in the midst of a very bitter primary campaign … we were still able to cooperate, because the problem was so massive and so important,” Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser during his presidency, recalled in a 2019 interview with HIAS. The ink was barely dry when an unexpected challenge arose But it wasn’t long before Carter would once again find himself making an unpopular decision. “We were challenged almost immediately, when the act was hardly dry, with crises that were not anticipated,” Eizenstat said in the 2019 HIAS interview. One of the most significant ones unfolded less than 100 miles from America’s shores. In April 1980, Cuban President Fidel Castro proclaimed that any Cuban citizen who wanted to emigrate to the United States could do so. The catch? They had to depart from the port of Mariel, about 30 miles from Havana. And they had to have arranged for someone on a boat to pick them up and take them to Florida. A US Marine helps a young Cuban child off a boat arriving in Key West, Florida, on May 10, 1980. Fernando Yovera/AP A few weeks later, addressing the League of Women Voters national convention in Miami, Carter noted that the US was a “country of refugees” that would “continue to provide an open heart and open arms” to those fleeing Cuba. The operation became known as the Mariel boatlift. Carter referred to the boats as “freedom flotillas.” But media coverage of those escaping oppression for the chance at a better life was quickly drowned out by reports claiming that Castro had also taken the opportunity to empty jails and mental institutions. In an interview with CNN on the network’s first day broadcasting, June 1, 1980, Carter faced questions over a Cuban refugee uprising at an Arkansas resettlement center, where buildings were set ablaze and hostages were taken. Several thousand hardened criminals did make their way to the United States during that exodus of 125,000 people, says José Manuel García, an associate professor of Hispanic literature and Latin American studies at Florida Southern College. It was a small fraction of the group, says García, who was part of the boatlift himself and has written a book and worked on a documentary sharing the experiences of others who made the journey. Florida Democrats shake President Jimmy Carter's hand as he enters the Florida House of Representatives chamber on October 10, 1980, prior to signing a bill providing up to $100 million to help reimburse Florida and other states after an influx of arrivals from Cuba and Haiti. Foley/AP García was 13 years old when he left Cuba with his family. And he says many Cubans who made that same journey went on to build successful businesses and media careers in the United States. But the bad reputation of the Cubans known as Marielitos firmly took root, even getting a mention in the opening of the 1983 movie “Scarface.” “Even years later, 40 years later, whenever I tell somebody…the first thing that pops in their mind is, ‘You came with those criminals.’ That is the image that has persisted,” García says. He says he sees Carter’s legacy differently than many Cuban Americans Carter, who was running for a second term, eventually shifted his stance on the boatlift. Washington and Havana agreed it would end just days before the 1980 election. Analysts argued Carter’s handling of the crisis was a factor contributing to his loss to Ronald Reagan. Beyond the 1980 presidential vote, there was likely another longer-term cost for Democrats, biographer Bird notes. The boatlift played a role in bolstering South Florida’s conservative political landscape, he says, as many Cubans who fled Castro’s communist regime ended up voting Republican once they became US citizens. This family photo shows José Manuel García with his father, mother and sister in 1980 a few days after they arrived in New York City after coming to the US in the Mariel boatlift. Courtesy Jose Manuel Garcia Among more conservative Cuban Americans, Carter is not a popular figure, García says. Many saw his handling of the boatlift as weak, and felt he was easily manipulated by Castro. But García says he sees Carter’s legacy differently. “He was a humanitarian. And this is somebody whose primary goal was, ‘We’re going to help these poor people who are escaping communism. They want a better life, and we’re going to do whatever we can to support them,’” he says. “I’ve had all these opportunities because of the fact that the Mariel boatlift happened … and President Carter was willing to help us come to the United States.” Carter’s actions may have cost him reelection, but García says they gave him — and so many others — a chance to live the lives they’d dreamed of having.\",\n",

The Texas Department of Public Safety said that its troopers had recovered the two little girls, who are five and nine years old, after the smuggler had abandoned them and fled back to Mexico. The girls, from El Salvador, carried only a note with an address and phone number, and were then referred to U.S. Border Patrol. {snip} There have been a number of incidents of abandoned children being rescued, often with phone numbers or addresses of relatives or others written on paper or stitched into clothing.

       "  'text': 'Posted on December 31, 2024 ICE Shuts Down Programs Offering Services to Illegal Immigrants Adam Shaw and Bill Melugin, Fox News, December 30, 2024 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has ended two programs that provide social services to illegal immigrants who are released into the U.S. interior, telling lawmakers that one brings “immense cost with little improvement” and that another is out of line with ICE’s mission. The agency responded to Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and 15 members of Congress, who wrote to ICE in May asking for more information about the “Alternatives to Detention” program, which monitors illegal immigrants not in ICE detention. The agency defended the program and said it was “an efficient and effective” program for monitoring a segment of illegal immigrants on ICE’s non-detained docket. ICE only has around 40,000 beds available to it at one time, while it has a non-detained docket of nearly 7.7 million people – a number that has soared during the Biden administration. Of those, just over 181,000 are enrolled in Alternatives to Detention monitoring program, where migrants are monitored either by an app check-in or a GPS monitor. But in recent years, the agency has also created separate programs to offer various services and assistance to those not in detention. In the letter, the agency says that some of those programs are ending. One is the Wraparound Stabilization Service (WSS), which ICE says began in February 2020 and involves working with NGOs to offer “services that provide psychosocial and behavioral health support for vulnerable participants and their families who would benefit from additional stabilization services.” ICE says the program stopped referrals in July, and that the program was ineffective in what it sought to do, having only a 2% higher compliance rate from those who took part in services compared to those who did not. “ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations [ERO] notes the challenge with the WSS was its immense cost with little improvement,” it says. {snip} ICE had previously cited difficulties with the program including a cumbersome identification and referral process, a substantial increase in participants and a lack of resources. The agency also says it had decided in June not to continue a vendor contract for the Young Adult Case Management (YACMP) program. That program offered 18-and 19-year-old migrants legal services, screenings, referrals to social service programs and human trafficking screenings . {snip} {snip}',\n",

       "  'text': 'Analytics Insights Tech Litigation in 2024 By the Numbers Facebook Twitter Linkedin by David Nayer December 31, 2024 As the year 2024 draws to a close, Docket Alarm analytics reveals that federal litigation is down in comparison to 2023,. 966,675 cases were filed in federal court in 2024, in comparison to 1,056,671 filed in 2023. Cases in 2023 Cases in 2024 This decrease of about 90,000 cases can be partially explained by the lack of multidistrict litigation. In 2023, the top jurisdiction for federal litigation was the Northern District of Florida, home to the massive 3M Combat Arms Earplugs multidistrict litigation, as covered by Law Street . This case concerned earplugs manufactured by a 3M subsidiary and distributed to soldiers; the lawsuits allege that the earplugs were defective and failed to protect the soldiers. The case settled in 2018 but the settlement claims process continued well into 2023. The Northern District of Florida served as the court where claims under this lawsuit were filed. Lawsuits against 3M spiked in 2023, but had comparatively little presence in 2024. The Northern District of Florida does not appear in the top 10 of filing jurisdictions in 2024. Taking Florida’s place in 2024 is the District of Arizona. Similar to the Florida instance, Arizona is home to another growing multidistrict litigation, In re Bard Implanted Port Catheter Products Liability Litigation In 2024, a greater proportion of the top 10 filing jurisdictions were bankruptcy courts. A forthcoming article will analyze bankruptcies in 2024 in comparison to prior years. 2023 Case Types Some trends have not changed from 2023 to 2024. Prisoner litigation is a top case type in both years, with around 18,000 cases. It is the top case type in 2024, but it lost out to Products Liability and Civil Rights in 2023. 2024 Case Types Other top case types in both years include insurance, contract, and immigration – but their order is different, depending on the year. Immigration and employment law cases are up, while personal injury matters are down year-over-year. Finally, the top non-governmental law firm in federal cases filed in 2024 is Drinker Biddle & Reath. The firm merged with Faegre Baker Daniels in 2020 to become Faegre Drinker, but federal court data occasionally retains pre-merger law firms for long-running cases. THe cases attributed to Drinker Biddle include another mutlidistrict matter against Johnson & Johnson . The firm represents the pharmaceutical company. The top filing law firm in 2024 was Arnold & Itkin. They are a plaintiff’s law firm; they represent plaintiffs in multistrict cases including the aforementioned same matter against Johnson & Johnson. . Tags Insights Facebook Twitter Linkedin',\n",

       "  'text': 'Woman burned to death inside New York City subway is identified Associated Press Dec 31, 2024 Dec 31, 2024 Updated Dec 31, 2024 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save NEW YORK (AP) — The woman who died after being set on fire in a New York subway train earlier this month was a 57-year-old from New Jersey, New York City police announced Tuesday. The woman, Debrina Kawam, was from Toms River, a township on the Jersey Shore, according to the NYPD. New York City Mayor Eric Adams added that Kawam had a “brief stint in our homeless shelter system,” though did not say when. It appears Kawam recently moved to New York and had a very brief interaction with the city\\'s outreach services, according to the New York City Department of Homeless Services. The man accused of lighting her on fire on Dec. 22, Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was taken into custody hours after police disseminated images of a suspect in the shocking Sunday morning attack on a train stopped in Brooklyn\\'s Coney Island. He has since been indicted on murder and arson charges. Identifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her. Adams said at an unrelated press briefing Tuesday that he didn\\'t know more than Kawam\\'s name and New Jersey address, but said authorities had been in contact with her next of kin. “Hearts go out to the family, a horrific incident to have to live through,” Adams said. “It impacts on how New Yorkers feel. But it really reinforces what I’ve been saying: People should not be living on our subway system, they should be in a place of care. No matter where she lived that should not have happened.” In an emailed statement, a New York City Department of Social Services spokesperson said the city\\'s homelessness agency worked with partners to track down any information they could on the victim’s family. “As we mourn this loss, we resolve to double down on our outreach efforts to reach and support New Yorkers experiencing unsheltered homelessness on city streets and subways and ensure they consistently access shelter services,\" the spokesperson said. Authorities have said they don\\'t believe Kawam and Zapeta knew each other. Federal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the U.S. illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support. Prosecutors allege both Kawam and Zapeta were on the stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station when Zapeta approached a sleeping Kawam and set her clothing on fire. He then fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned, prosecutors said. Kawam was pronounced dead at the scene. Zapeta was arrested later that day after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students. Zapeta has yet to enter a plea in the case and remains jailed. He was not present at a court hearing Friday where his indictment was announced and his attorney declined to comment afterward. Prosecutor Ari Rottenberg said at the hearing that Zapeta told police he drinks a lot of liquor and doesn’t know what happened. He did, however, identify himself in photos and surveillance video showing the fire being lit, Rottenberg said. “This was a malicious deed,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said after the Friday hearing. ___ This story corrects Kawam\\'s age based on updated information from the police. She was 57, not 61.

       "  'text': \"Roberts warns against ignoring Supreme Court rulings as tension with Trump looms John Fritze, CNN Tue, December 31, 2024 at 11:01 PM UTC 4 min read The US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, US, on October 2, 2024. Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts slammed what he described as “dangerous” talk by some officials about ignoring federal court rulings, using an annual report weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office to stress the importance of an independent judiciary. Officials “from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,” Roberts wrote in the report, released by the Supreme Court on Tuesday. “These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.” The chief justice didn’t detail which officials he had in mind – and both Republicans and Democrats have hinted at ignoring court rulings in recent years. Still, Roberts’ year-end message landed days before the January 20 inauguration of a president who has repeatedly decried the federal judiciary as rigged. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump’s agenda – particularly on immigration – could put the incoming president on a collision course next year with a Supreme Court he has helped to build by naming three conservative justices during his first term. “Every administration suffers defeats in the court system – sometimes in cases with major ramifications,” Roberts wrote. And yet, he added, “for the past several decades,” both parties have respected court decisions and have headed off the kind of constitutional confrontations that arose during the civil rights era when some southern states declined court orders to integrate. Roberts, in particular, pointed to decisions by the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations to enforce school desegregation rulings. In 1957, for instance, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to integrate its schools after officials sought to defy Supreme Court decisions that found segregated schools unconstitutional.

       "  'text': 'Roberts warns against ignoring Supreme Court rulings as tension with Trump looms John Fritze, CNN January 1, 2025 at 1:01 AM The US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, US, on October 2, 2024. (Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images) Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts slammed what he described as “dangerous” talk by some officials about ignoring federal court rulings, using an annual report weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office to stress the importance of an independent judiciary. Officials “from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings,” Roberts wrote in the report, released by the Supreme Court on Tuesday. “These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.” The chief justice didn’t detail which officials he had in mind – and both Republicans and Democrats have hinted at ignoring court rulings in recent years. Still, Roberts’ year-end message landed days before the January 20 inauguration of a president who has repeatedly decried the federal judiciary as rigged. Trump’s agenda – particularly on immigration – could put the incoming president on a collision course next year with a Supreme Court he has helped to build by naming three conservative justices during his first term. “Every administration suffers defeats in the court system – sometimes in cases with major ramifications,” Roberts wrote. And yet, he added, “for the past several decades,” both parties have respected court decisions and have headed off the kind of constitutional confrontations that arose during the civil rights era when some southern states declined court orders to integrate. Roberts, in particular, pointed to decisions by the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations to enforce school desegregation rulings. In 1957, for instance, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to integrate its schools after officials sought to defy Supreme Court decisions that found segregated schools unconstitutional. Roberts lamented that “public officials,” whom he also did not name, had “regrettably” attempted to intimidate judges by “suggesting political bias in the judge’s adverse rulings without a credible basis for such allegations.” Those attempts, he warned, are “inappropriate and should be vigorously opposed.” As in past years, the chief justice avoided direct mention of the controversies and challenges brewing within the Supreme Court itself – including lingering questions about ethics , a weekslong scandal this year over controversial flags hoisted at Justice Samuel Alito’s properties and sagging public confidence in the nation’s highest court.

Credit: AP New York Police officers clear a train at the Coney Island Stillwell Avenue Terminal, May 5, 2020, in the Brooklyn borough of New York. Author: Associated Press Published: 1:22 PM EST December 31, 2024 Updated: 4:43 PM EST December 31, 2024 NEW YORK — The woman who died after being set on fire in a New York subway train earlier this month was a 57-year-old from New Jersey, New York City police announced Tuesday. The woman, Debrina Kawam, was from Toms River, a township on the Jersey Shore, according to the NYPD. New York City Mayor Eric Adams added that Kawam had a “brief stint in our homeless shelter system,” though did not say when. The man accused of lighting her on fire on Dec. 22, Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was taken into custody hours after police disseminated images of a suspect in the shocking Sunday morning attack on a train stopped in Brooklyn's Coney Island. He has since been indicted on murder and arson charges. Identifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her. Adams said at an unrelated press briefing Tuesday that he didn't know more than Kawam's name and New Jersey address, but said authorities had been in contact with her next of kin. “Hearts go out to the family, a horrific incident to have to live through,” Adams said. “It impacts on how New Yorkers feel. But it really reinforces what I’ve been saying: People should not be living on our subway system, they should be in a place of care. No matter where she lived that should not have happened.” Authorities have said they don't believe Kawam and Zapeta knew each other. Federal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the U.S. illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support. Prosecutors allege both Kawam and Zapeta were on the stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station when Zapeta approached a sleeping Kawam and set her clothing on fire. He then fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned, prosecutors said. Kawam was pronounced dead at the scene. Zapeta was arrested later that day after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students. Zapeta has yet to enter a plea in the case and remains jailed. He was not present at a court hearing Friday where his indictment was announced and his attorney declined to comment afterward. Prosecutor Ari Rottenberg said at the hearing that Zapeta told police he drinks a lot of liquor and doesn’t know what happened. He did, however, identify himself in photos and surveillance video showing the fire being lit, Rottenberg said. “This was a malicious deed,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said after the Friday hearing. ___ This story corrects Kawam's age based on updated information from the police. She was 57, not 61. Close Ad\",\n",

Credit: AP New York Police officers clear a train at the Coney Island Stillwell Avenue Terminal, May 5, 2020, in the Brooklyn borough of New York. Author: Associated Press Published: 12:22 PM CST December 31, 2024 Updated: 2:14 PM CST December 31, 2024 NEW YORK — The woman who died after being set on fire in a New York subway train earlier this month was a 57-year-old from New Jersey, New York City police announced Tuesday. The woman, Debrina Kawam, was from Toms River, a township on the Jersey Shore, according to the NYPD. New York City Mayor Eric Adams added that Kawam had a “brief stint in our homeless shelter system,” though did not say when. The man accused of lighting her on fire on Dec. 22, Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was taken into custody hours after police disseminated images of a suspect in the shocking Sunday morning attack on a train stopped in Brooklyn's Coney Island. He has since been indicted on murder and arson charges. Identifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her. Adams said at an unrelated press briefing Tuesday that he didn't know more than Kawam's name and New Jersey address, but said authorities had been in contact with her next of kin. “Hearts go out to the family, a horrific incident to have to live through,” Adams said. “It impacts on how New Yorkers feel. But it really reinforces what I’ve been saying: People should not be living on our subway system, they should be in a place of care. No matter where she lived that should not have happened.” Authorities have said they don't believe Kawam and Zapeta knew each other. Federal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the U.S. illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support. Prosecutors allege both Kawam and Zapeta were on the stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station when Zapeta approached a sleeping Kawam and set her clothing on fire. He then fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned, prosecutors said. Kawam was pronounced dead at the scene. Zapeta was arrested later that day after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students. Zapeta has yet to enter a plea in the case and remains jailed. He was not present at a court hearing Friday where his indictment was announced and his attorney declined to comment afterward. Prosecutor Ari Rottenberg said at the hearing that Zapeta told police he drinks a lot of liquor and doesn’t know what happened. He did, however, identify himself in photos and surveillance video showing the fire being lit, Rottenberg said. “This was a malicious deed,” Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said after the Friday hearing. ___ This story corrects Kawam's age based on updated information from the police.

       "  'text': 'Democrats are to blame for record homelessness By Zachary Faria Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print December 31, 2024 2:11 pm Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print The Department of Housing and Urban Development has found there is now a record number of homeless people in the United States. Liberal policies are primarily to blame. The homelessness census report found that homelessness in the U.S. increased by 18% to a record number of 771,480. That 18% increase from 2023 to 2024 is made worse when you know that homelessness increased by 19% from 2007 to 2024, making the jump from 2023 to 2024 responsible for nearly the entire increase over the last 17 years. BREAKING NEWS – Today HUD released data showing homelessness has reached a record high in the U.S. in 2024, with over 120K more documented homeless compared to last year. 771,480 people experienced homelessness on a single night this past January, including 150,000 children. pic.twitter.com/f1NBe1ARK1 — Torraine Walker (@TorraineWalker) December 27, 2024 Of the six states that saw an increase of 25% or more in their homeless population, just two are run by Republicans. Alabama’s homeless population went up by nearly 1,300 people, though the state’s homelessness rate remains relatively low compared to the rest of the country, while West Virginia, which gained 363 homeless people, still has a better homelessness rate than many of its neighbors. The other four states are bastions of Democratic governance: Colorado, an increase of 4,276; Massachusetts, an increase of 10,219; Illinois, an increase of 13,885; and New York, an increase of a whopping 54,819. Those four states happen to be the ones that have encouraged illegal immigrants to cross the border, leading Texas to send those illegal immigrants their way. New York City and Illinois have been overwhelmed by illegal immigrants, leading to homeless shelter restrictions and a lack of city resources to deal with that crisis or other city functions. Massachusetts had to deploy National Guard members to serve as glorified maids at hotels housing newly arrived illegal immigrants. Colorado is now home to the unofficial American headquarters of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The failed immigration policies of the Biden administration, as well as those four states actively encouraging illegal immigrants to swarm the border with promises of “sanctuary,” are behind the massive surges in the homeless population. California, the model state for Democratic failures in governance on homelessness and everything else, rounds out the top five states with the biggest total increase in homeless people, though Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) boasted that California’s rate of homelessness increased at less than the national average. Newsom also said CalMatters ’ s homeless estimation for California was unreliable and unverified in an effort to downplay it, only for HUD’s numbers to be even higher than what CalMatters had. From the Biden administration’s failed immigration policies to sanctuary states and cities inviting people they can’t house to California’s general incompetence, Democratic policies are the chief driver of the record homelessness we are seeing today. If you don’t think this problem can continue to get worse, you aren’t familiar with the stubbornness of Democrats in power in the face of their own massive failures.

Latin Times Steve Bannon welcomed growing tensions between the MAGA movement and Elon Musk over immigration policy, particularly regarding the H-1B visa program, calling the \"escalation\" a positive development. On his WarRoom podcast, Bannon criticized Musk\\'s support for the H-1B program , a visa category that allows skilled foreign workers to fill U.S. jobs, arguing it undercuts American workers and goes against President-elect Donald Trump\\'s immigration agenda, Mediaite reported . \"It\\'s unfortunate that things have escalated the way they have escalated, but we\\'ll see,\" fellow Musk critic Laura Loomer said during the discussion. Loomer, who has faced account restrictions on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), accused Musk of \"abuse\" toward the MAGA base, citing inflammatory comments such as calling critics \"retarded\" and urging them to \"go f*** yourself in the face.\" Bannon, however, dismissed Musk\\'s insults and took a combative stance, saying, \"I think escalation\\'s good. When an enemy\\'s in retreat, fix bayonets and pursue.\" He added that the MAGA movement has become resilient after years of political conflict. \"We\\'re battle-hardened [after] over a decade of fighting,\" Bannon said. \"People are — hey, it\\'s nothing.\" Bannon has long advocated for the elimination of the H-1B program, while Musk and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have defended it as a solution to a skills gap in the U.S. workforce.
